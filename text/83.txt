Noise Annoyance Among Factory and Construction Workers: Construct Development

Madeleine J. Kerr, Sally L Lusk, and Rosemary Ziemba

Exposure to worksite noise is a source of stress and a cause of hearing loss. 
The extent to which the individual perceives the noise as annoying likely 
affects stress levels and may moderate use of hearing protection devices. In 
this study, perceptions of noise annoyance are described for three samplcs of 
workers; automotive plant workers (n=398), construction workers in three 
trades (n=450) and a national sample of plumbers and pipefitters (n=149). An 
instrument to measure noise annoyance was adapted from questions used in a 
field study by van Dijk, Souman, and deVries (1987).

The proportion of workers who perceived various aspects of noise as annoying 
varied from 24 to 83 percent. Impaired communication was the most prevalent 
noise-related complaint across all samples (71 to 83%). ANOVA was used to 
compare noise annoyance among construction worker subgroups; operating 
engineers reported significantly more noise annoyance and carpenters reported 
the least. Narrative data from workers in the three samples identified 
noise-sensitive activities and work noises that are especially disturbing. 
Further elaboration of the construct of noise annoyance will contribute to 
explanatory models of work stress and hearing protection use.
