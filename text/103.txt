Preliminary Studies to Assess the Reliability and Validity of the Diabetes 
Knowledge Survey for Native Americans (DKSNA)

Sara J. Boskovich

The Diabetes Knowledge Survey for Native Americans (DKSNA) was developed in 
response to a felt clinical need. Although culturally specific diabetes 
education programs have been developed there is a lack of diabetes knowledge 
instruments for Native Americans with Type II diabetes. Most available 
instruments are designed for clients with Type I diabetes, have high 
readability levels, are too long or are culturally inappropriate. Preliminary 
studies on the DKSNA include a pilot on Native Americans with type II 
diabetes, N=30. Of the 14 items representing five domains of diabetes 
knowledge; a) general knowledge, b) nutrition, c) complications, d) symptom 
recognition, and e) exercise, an alpha of 0.66 was obtained. Item difficulty 
ranged from -0.06 to 0.90. The frequency distribution for the total scores on 
the items showed a somewhat skewed pattern to the left indicating a relatively 
easy test. Results of the Flesch Kincaid indicated a fourth grade reading 
level. Minor changes were made in the items. After conducting content validity 
studies on this instrument we will proceed with a multi-site testing at Indian 
Health Service (IHS) sites to evaluate validity.
