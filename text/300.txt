Providing Support to Hospitalized Pregnant Women on Bedrest: Methods and 
Emerging Themes

Barbara F. Ponder and Judith A. Maloni

As many as 20% of all pregnant women are bedrested at some time during their 
pregnancies. Bed rest engenders multiple financial, emotional, and physical 
costs to the woman and her family. As a result women find themselves with 
insufficient methods for coping with this situation. This presentation will 
describe: a) provision of supportive group c?re to pregnant bedrested women 
hospitalized in a perinatal referral center; and b) results of a dimensional 
analysis (Schatzman, 1992; Strauss, 1987) of the process recordings of each 
group session over a period of 18 months. The following provisional dimensions 
of the antepartum bedrest experience emerged from ongoing data collection and 
analysis: Disturbing Emotions, Balancing Family Needs and Role Reallocations, 
Forced Dependence/Confinement. Isolation, and Conflict regarding health of 
self and fetus. The dimensionS will be used to develop a conceptual framework 
to guide nursing practice and research of the hospitalized pregnant woman.
