Morphine in the A7 Catecholamine Cell Group Produces Hyperalgesia

Jeanean E. Holden and H. K. Proudfit

Despite the ubiquitous nature of pain, it is poorly understood and often 
poorly treated clinically. Understanding physiological responses to painful 
stimuli may lead to better treatment methods. We identified methionine-
enkephalinergic (mENK) neurons from the ventromedial medulla (VMM) that 
project to the A7 catecholamine cell group in the dorsolateral pontine 
tegmentum. The A7 cell group contains noradrenergic (NE) neurons that 
innvervate the spinal cord dorsal horn and attenuate painful stimuli. To 
determine the behavioral effect of these MENK cells, we microinjected the mu 
receptor agonist, morphine sulfate (MS), into the A7 area of rats (n=8). 
Because MS is usually inhibitory, we predicted that MS microinjections would 
inhibit NE neurons, resulting in an increased response to pain, or 
hyperalgesia. Using the tail flick analgesiometric test, we obtained a 
significant hyperalgesic response from MS compared to saline controls at 5, 
15, 30 and 60 minutes post injection (p<.05; Univariate ANOVA with Bonferroni 
comparison). Our findings suggest that mENK neurons from the VMM may inhibit 
the analgesic effect of A7 noradrenergic neurons, thus preserving the 
protective aspects of a pain stimulus.
