Older Adults: Age Differnces in Exercise and Exercise-Related Variables

Vicki S. Conn and J. Armer

Beneficial effects of exercise for older adults have been well documented. 
Several studies have documented age differences between younger- and older- 
adults for exercise related variables. The purpose of this study was to 
identify age differences in several measures of exercise and important 
exercise-related variables among young-old (65 through 74 years), middle-old 
(75 through 84 years), and old-old (85 years and over) adults. Independently 
living older adults were recruited for the study (N=117). Exercise, exertion, 
and physical activity were measured by the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile, 
Baecke Index, and Framingham Physical Activity Index. Self-efficacy and 
perceived benefits and barriers were measured by McAuley's self-efficacy scale 
and the Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale. Exertion scores differed between 
middle- and old-old but not between young- and middle-old subjects. Exercise 
scores differed significanty between each age group. Self-efficacy scores 
differed only between young- and old-old subjects. No age differences in 
perceived barriers were found. Significant differences in several perceived 
benefits subscale scores were documented. These findings imply that 
gerontological nursing exercise research should address the heterogeneity of 
older adults.
