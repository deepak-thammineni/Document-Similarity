Family Illness Deeds Following the Diagnosis of Chronic Illness

Kathryn H. Anderson

This study examined the nature of illness demands on 78 families subsequent to 
diagnosis of a chronic illness. Data were collected by mailed survey two 
months after the diagnosis in the outpatient setting. The attribution score of 
the demands of the illness (DOII) questionnaire (Woods, Haberman, & Packard, 
1987) was used to measure illness demands. Illness demands, from the chronic 
illnesses diagnosed in study patients, were examined for the sample families 
as a whole. Similarities and differences in patient and family member 
responses with illness demands were also explored. Family illness demands in 
this sample were found using t-tests to be significantly less than the demands 
in the normative sample, and were found to be significantly negatively 
correlated to family quality of life and positively correlated with illness 
severity. Sample characteristics of early chronic illness demands were 
identified. Implications for research and practice will be discussed. Study 
results support inclusion of family illness demands as an important factor in 
family illness stress.
