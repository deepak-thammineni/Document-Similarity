Prenatal Substance Abuse Exposure: Effects on the Maternal-Infant Interaction

Rosemary Liguori

This study investigated the effects of exposure to cocaine on vocal, visual, 
tactile and mutual gaze interactions of 60 neonates (2-28 days of age) and 
their mothers. Mother-infant interaction was videotaped by the investigator in 
the subject's home; the Broussard Neonatal Perception Inventory (NPI) was 
completed by the mother to examine maternal perceptions. The Parent Interview 
form was used to obtain demographic information. Findings did not support the 
hypothesis that significant differences would occur in the duration and 
frequencies of interactive behaviors between the two groups, nor were 
significant differences found in interaction by infant gender and drug group. 
According to the NPI, mothers in both groups perceived their infants 
positively. This data suggests that use of cocaine prenatally does not affect 
the overall quantity of mother-infant interaction in the first month of life. 
A qualitative investigation of the cocaine exposed dyad seems warranted, since 
differences were noted anecdotally.
