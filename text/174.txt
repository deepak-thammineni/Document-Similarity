Problem. A college of nursing and a metropolitan teaching hospital are 
conducting a CHF Outreach Study addressing: readmission rate, quality of life, 
impact of home care educational intervention, and expansion of student 
experiences. A 4-group experimental design was used to test patient outcomes. 
This paper will address the challenges over come in setting up the research 
intervention as a student experience.

Sample. Delivering the educational intervention each quarter involves 10-30 
students. Approximately 6 students provide continuity during academic breaks 
through a co-op education experience.

Methodology. Challenges include securing adequate numbers of students for a 
fluctuating sample, establishing curriculum placement, standardizing 
interventions, establishing a co-op experience addressing a community-based, 
research focused clinical.

Results. The first year found educational goals on track.

Implications. There is potential for many applications as nursing programs 
seek community experiences and health care researchers study the safety and 
efficacy of changes in health care delivery.
