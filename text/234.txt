Exaggerated Cardiovascular Reactivity: An Early Indicator of Hypertension in 
Prepubescent African American Children

Jenise V. Gillespie

Exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR] 
response to stressful stimuli) in children has been shown to be an important 
predictor of hypertension later in life. Further, we know the prevalence of 
hypertension in African Americans is twice of European Americans. There is 
empirical evidence to suggest that aerobic exercise training in adults can 
help control heart rate and blood pressure responses to the stress induced by 
acute exercise. Therefore, it may be possible that exercise can help control 
exaggerated reactivity in children. Unfortunately, there is no literature to 
describe this in children. This experimental study will use a two group, pre-
test/post-test design with children assigned at random to the experimental and 
control groups. The levels of the independent variable will be aerobic 
exercise training and no aerobic exercise training. The primary dependent 
variable examined will be reactivity as measured by maximum minus minimum 
baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In order to examine the difference 
between the groups in changes in reactivity an ANCOVA will be performed 
entering the pre-test value as a covariate (alpha set a priori at .05). Should 
there be a decrease in exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity with exercise 
training in prepubescent African.
