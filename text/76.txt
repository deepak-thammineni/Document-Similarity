Nurse Staffing and Patient Outcomes

Mary A. Blegen, Colleen Goode, and Laura Reed

Hospitals' attempts to enhance operational efficiency with work redesign often 
involve using non-licensed personnel. This has led to concerns about the 
quality of nursing care and subsequent patient outcomes. Research that 
systematically evaluates the effects nurse to patient ratio and skill mix on 
patient outcomes is needed; but, the few studies available are restricted to 
nurse staffing indicators for the hospital as a whole and to patient mortality 
as the outcome.

This study describes the relationships among staffing levels and patient 
outcomes at the level ofthe nursing care unit (N=42). Staffing indicators 
include proportion of FTE staff that are RNs and of hours of care per patient 
day given by RNs. Patient indicators include unit rates of RNs morbidity, 
mortality, and adverse occurrences such as medication errors, falls, 
infections, and complaints. Severity of patient illness across units is 
controlled using an institutionally standardized measure of patient acuity. 
Multivariate analysis are done to determine relationships among indicators of 
nurse staffing, patient outcomes and control variables.
