Meta-Interpretation of Courage Among Individuals with Long-Term Health 
Concerns

A meta-interpretation is a study in which findings from multiple qualitative 
research projects are synthesized. Synthesis of qualitative findings is 
important in order to talk to colleagues, policy makers, and concerned 
citizens about health care issues. Meta-interpretation is also valuable in the 
application of qualitative research results and theory development. The 
purpose of this project was to synthesize findings from three qualitative 
studies of courage among individuals with long-term health concerns. Synthesis 
involved analyzing each study indepndently, determining the type of 
relationship that existed among the studies, translating them into one 
another, and synthesizing the translations into a conceptual model using the 
constant comparative method. Results indicate that courage is learned over 
time and continues to develop while managing life with long-term health 
concerns. This process is characterized by ongoing struggles and involves 
accepting reality, employing problem solving skills, and pushing oneself to 
live life to its fullest in spite of difficulties. The results are vitality 
and a rest for living that exceed the sense that one has merely coped. 
Intrapersonal and interpersonal factors, including health care providers, play 
a role in promoting and maintaining courage.
