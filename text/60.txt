The Nurse's Role in Retirement Home Residents' Leisure

Lois Roelofs

Although a major goal of nursing is health promotion, the domain of leisure is 
often overlooked in health promotion activities. Thus grounded theory method 
was used to explore retirement home residents' perceptions of how nurses could 
influence their free or leisure time. Theoretical sampling included 39 
residents; data collection consisted of participant observation and intensive 
interviewing; and data analysis involved constant comparative method. The 
majority of subjects responded that they were unaware of how nurses could 
influence their free or leisure time. That the nurses were "doing enough 
already" emerged as the core category. This category included the nursing 
strategies of "treating us kindly" and "helping with problems." These findings 
support a need to identify, validate, and teach health promotion nursing 
interventions for leisure related nursing diagnoses, such as NANDA's 
Diversional Activity Deficit. These interventions would enable gerontological 
nurses to plan care that promotes mental, physical, and spiritual health and, 
thereby, influences older persons' quality of life.
