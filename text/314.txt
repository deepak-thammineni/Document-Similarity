Critical Social Theory: Amplifying the Voices of HIV-Infected Minority Women

Debra E. Lyon

PURPOSE: Although nursing research focused on HIV infection in minority 
populations is one of the stated priorities of the NNCR (1994), research in 
this population raises many issues that defy simple adaptation of existing 
research strategies. The multifaceted needs and resources of these individuals 
warrant an approach that includes both personal, familial and societal 
considerations of lethal stigmatic illness. Critical social theory provides a 
framework for overcoming the detachment of analytic research and the 
"bracketing" of interpretive methods to provide for emancipation of 
participants, both researcher and those who are engaged as participants in a 
study.

SAMPLE/METHODS: A pilot study will be initiated in 1995 at the Virginia 
Commonwealth University HIV/AIDS Center to elicit the voices of women who are 
living with HIV. These individual voices will be examined both within the 
societal and the medical/nursing paradigms in order to illuminate the 
strengths, limitations and perceived vulnerabilities of minority women with 
HIV. The strategy outlined by Held (1980) will be used to provide a broad 
framework for the research methodology in this study; appropriate adaptation 
will be made by participants and researcher.

IMPLICATIONS: This study will contribute a view of minority women living with 
HIV within the societal context of stigmatic disease, poverty, racism, and 
sexism. Findings will have implications for future nursing research in 
marginalized populations.
