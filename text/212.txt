A Philosophical Inquiry of Orem's General Theory of Nursing

Barbara Banfield

The purpose of this study is to investigate the philosophical foundations of 
Orem's Self Care Deficit Theory of Nursing (SCDTN) through the use of 
philosophical inquiry. The research questions pertain to the metaphysical 
position of Orem's SCDTN regarding the nature of human beings as well as to 
the appropriateness of existing research methods for the development of 
knowledge related to Orem's SCDTN.

The inquiry's conceptualization is based on Lauden's views of science and 
Orem's views of nursing as a practical science.

This philosophical inquiry is primarily of the argumentation by analysis form. 
This approach involves the critical examination and analysis of literature in 
order to explicate philosophical underpinnings and assumptions, to clarify 
meanings, and to identify inconsistencies. The literature examined in this 
study includes the writings of Orem and those authors whom she has identified 
as influencing her thinking as well as the literature pertaining to the 
philosophical foundations of various research methods. The findings of the 
study will be subjected to appropriate evaluation criteria.

The findings from this philosophical inquiry will represent scientific 
progress related to Orem's SCDTN through the explication of Orem's position 
regarding the nature of human beings and through the identification of 
research methods appropriate for knowledge development related to this model. 
This will provide a foundation for further development of the SCDTN as well as 
provide direction for research studies designed to generate knowledge related 
to the SCDTN.
