A Comparison of Nurses' and Patients' Perception of Patient Needs and 
Satisfaction in the Emergency Department

Jennifer J. Hostutler

Meeting the needs of an emergency department patient can be a challenging 
task. Often the patient may have needs that are not expressed to the nurse. 
When this occurs unmet needs may lead to dissatisfaction with care. The 
purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine whether patients and 
nurses have the same perception of patient needs; and (2) to determine which 
patient needs are important for patient satisfaction.

A nonprobability convenience sample was obtained for the patient population by 
randomly selecting 600 patients that were seen in the emergency department 
between February 1 and April 30, 1995. Nurses working in the emergency 
department during the same time period constituted the second sample. Both 
samples were given a questionnaire to complete. There were twenty-seven, four 
point Likert scale questions for each questionnaire. The patient 
questionnaires had an additional ten questions that were open-ended. Content 
focused on communication, visitation, and education. The study site was an 
acute care community hospital in an urban setting that averages 70,000 
emergency visits a year.

Preliminary analysis of 174 questionnaires reveals that there are several 
areas where nurses and patients have different perceptions of patient needs.
