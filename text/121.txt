The Role of Home Health Care in the Explanation of Strain and Depression in 
Family Caregivers of Older Adults

Karen A. Schwarz

Research about home care nurses as providers of social support to caregivers 
of functionally impaired older adults residing in the community is limited. 
The purpose of the study was to determine if informal and formal social 
support moderated the relationship between strain and depression. The 
buffering effect of older adults living in the community were interviewed in 
their homes soon after receiving hospital services and three months later 
about strain, depression, positive caregiving appraisal, informal social 
support, satisfaction with social support, and coping. Strain, depression, and 
positive caregiving appraisal were not significantly different after three 
months between those with home care and those without home care when 
controlling for pretest measures. Social support did not moderate the 
relationship of strain and depression. Additionally, strain and depression 
were significantly higher for caregivers to persons who were cognitively 
impaired and for female caregivers. Satisfaction with informal social support 
was negatively related to strain and depression. Further study is needed about 
the impact of home health care on caregivers of the older adult and 
enhancement of positive caregiving appraisal.
