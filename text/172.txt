Effects of Reduced Clinical Hours on Critical Thinking Skills: A Pilot Study

Carole A. Pepa and Cynthia A. Russell

One strategy to accommodate increased numbers of nursing students and 
decreased inpatient medical surgical censuses is to reduce clinical hours. 
Little is know, however, about the effects of reduced clinical hours on the 
students' ability to critically think. The purpose of this study was to 
compare critical thinking scores of a small group of students (N=12) before 
and after the reduction of medical-surgical clinical hours. Students were 
matched on age, course grade, and instructor. The Clinical Nursing Assessment 
Medical-Surgical Nursing I (Test CNS01) was used to measure critical thinking. 
A paired t-test was used to compare the critical thinking scores of the 
matched pairs. No difference between the two groups was found (t=2.29, p=.06). 
These findings provide exploratory information about the critical thinking 
skills of students in the clinical setting and have implications for teaching 
strategies and future research.
