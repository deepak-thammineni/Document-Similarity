Preventing Pressure Ulcers: A Comparison of No Support Surfaces in an At-Risk 
Skilled Nursing Facility Population

The current state of scientific knowledge of devices designed to prevent 
pressure ulcers is based on skin interface pressure rather than incidence of 
pressure ulcers. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of 
pressure ulcers in 40, newly admitted, at risk (Braden Scale Score < 18), 
skilled nursing facility residents, randomly assigned to the Iris 3000 
mattress overlay or the Maxifloat mattress replacement. The sample consisted 
of 22 females and 18 males in each group. The mean age of patients on Iris 
3000 was 80 years; Maxifloat mattress 74 years. Head to toe skin assessments 
were done every other day for 21 days using the Bergstrom Skin Assessment 
tool. Twelve patients on the Iris versus 5 patients on the Maxifloat developed 
pressure ulcers (X2 5.01, p=.o25). Body Mass Index (BMI) (wt/ht X ht/1000) 
differed significantly between groups (F 1.54, p=.01) with Maxifloat group 
mean being greater than Iris group mean. Maxifloat mattresses cost $220 and 
have a life of 5 years; Iris 3000 overlays are single use products costing the 
institution $38 each. Five year institutional use of Maxifloat mattresses can 
save >$50,000 over single-use foam. In conclusion, fewer subjects on Maxifloat 
had pressure ulcers despite having a greater BMI than those on Iris. The 
Maxifloat also proved to be more cost effective.
