Quality and Cost Outcomes Comparing Physician and Midwifery Practices

Patricia Hinton Walker and Patricia Stone

Purpose. This pilot study compared two different models of prenatal and 
childbirth care in terms of the processes of care, cost and clinical outcomes.

Methodology. A retrospective review of prenatal and hospital records was 
undertaken at two different practices that deliver prenatal care in a single 
community. The models of care area birth center (BC) and a traditional 
practice (TP). Both the BC and TP groups are connected to the same hospital. A 
total of 50 subjects were included in this study. All subjects met the 
inclusion criteria of being birth center eligible at 36 weeks gestation.

Results. Processes of care during the prenatal period: no differences. 
However, there were significant differences in processes of care during labor 
and delivery. The BC group was less likely to receive intravenous fluids 
(F=4.5, p<.05) and length of stay was significantly shorter (F=15.5, p<.05). 
There was no difference in clinical outcomes of care of the mother and irfant. 
The study explores models of comparing costs of care including providers fees, 
costs of interventions, and facility costs which will be presented for future 
research.

Conclusions. This research provides an organizing framework for comparing the 
cost and quality outcomes of primary prevention models of care and use of 
mid-level practitioners (CNM's) in the context of a changing, health care 
environment.
