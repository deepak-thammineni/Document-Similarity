The Theory of Integration and its Application in Diabetes and Other Chronic 
Illnesses

Cheri A. Hernandez

This theoretical paper will describe the theory of integration and identify 
possibilities for application of this theory in clinical practice and research 
settings. The theory of integration was developed through initial grounded 
theory study and two follow-up investigations in individuals with insulin 
dependent diabetes mellitus. here are three phases of integration: having 
diabetes, the turning point, and the science of one. Individuals in the third 
phase had a metaphoric theme, a metaphor of integration, that demonstrated the 
process of living in which the diabetic self and the personal self have become 
integrated. Subjects exhibited "lifeways", characteristic patterns of thought 
or action used without conscious knowledge, that facilitated the diabetes 
integration process. Current and proposed uses of this theory in chronic 
illness research will be described, including intervention studies. Potential 
applications in client-nurse relationships and diabetes education program 
format and materials will also be identified.
