Heart Failure Decompensation: Precipitants and Strategies for Case Management

Susan J. Bennett, S. L. Baker, L. B. Milgrom, and M. L. Pressler

Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly 
individuals. The purpose of this retrospective study ws to identify and rank 
order the principal reason(s) for hospitalization of persons with HF. All 1992 
admissions to a tertiary care university medical center coded for HF were 
audit (N=319). The 319 admissions included a total of 250 patients. Validity 
of the HF diagnosis was supported by clinical, radiologic, and/or 
echocardiographic criteria in 186 (74%) of the 250 patients. HF was a primary 
or secondary reason for hospitalization in 159 (85%) of the 186 patients. The 
most significant decompensating factor was excessive sodium retention (pitting 
edema, > 2 kg weight gain) which occurred in 79 (50%) of the 159 patients. 
Two- to 3-times less frequently, myocardial ischemia, dysrhythmia, and 
infaction precipitated admission. The results suggest that a case management 
approach structured to optimize body weight (via patient education, adherence 
to dietary Na restriction, and titration of diuretics) might lessen the need 
for impatient therapy.
