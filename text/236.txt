Fostering Influenza and Pneumococcal Immunization: A Nursing Intervention for 
Older Adults

Jennifer Peters

Influenza and pneumococcal immunizations are recommended for all older adults, 
yet few are immunized. Limited intervention research focuses on adult 
immunization. This study examined the effect of immunization education and 
persuasive behavioral counseling on the immunization behavior, health beliefs, 
and immunization knowledge of rural older Iowans. The Health Belief Model 
served as the study's theoretical base. A Solomon Four Group experimental 
design with repeated measures was used. Subjects (n=115) were Caucasians with 
a mean age of 73. Sixty percent were female. Dependent variables were 
evaluated at baseline and periodically over a 15 month period. Intervention 
had a significant, positive effect on immunization behavior, selected health 
beliefs, and immunization knowledge. Following intervention, experimental 
subjects demonstrated a 22% increase in influenza immunization and a 50% 
increase in pneumococcal immunization. The study has implications for nurse 
educators and nurses caring for older adults in all clinical settings. In 
addition, the study provides information relevant to future investigations of 
health behaviors of older adults and the Health Belief Model.
