Child Pain: Differences in Perceptions of Pain Intensity and Perceived Ability 
to Manage Pain

Dianne Miller and Debbie Berry

Assuming pain is experienced by children as they describe it, this 
investigation, part of a larger descriptive study, focused on the interactive 
nature of pain perception: differences in perceptions of pain intensity 
between children, their mothers, and their nurses and mothers' and nurses' 
ability to manage pain. Using a convenience sample (n=255) of 75 sets of 
matched subjects (hospitalized child 3-18, the mother, and the nurse), 
simultaneous but independent pain intensity ratings (Wong-Baker Faces Scale) 
were collected from each set member. Mothers and nurses were also asked to 
rate their own ability to handle the child's pain on a 4-point scale. 
Significant differences in pain rating discrepancies between set-member pairs 
were tested using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks. Correlations between 
extent of discrepancy in pain ratings and rankings of ability to manage pain 
were tested using chi-square. Clinical implications for children's pain 
management with families will be discussed, including subject statements.
