Expert Nurses' Lived Experiences of Giving Quality Care: What Makes the 
Difference?

Betsy Frank, Helene Eckrich, and Julie Rohr

Nurses can identify quality care indicators. Using primarily quantitative 
methods previous research has focused on the indicators while ignoring the 
context of the care given. The purpose of this study was to explore the lived 
experience of giving quality care. Seven expert nurses were interviewed. Data 
were analyzed using phenomenological mehtods outlined by Streubert (1991). 
Emerged themes descriptive of nurses' lived experience of giving quality care 
could be likened to playing a symphony. The theme of "leadership makes a 
difference" was evident through the nurse manager or conductor who set the 
tone and obtained resources. A second theme, "standards are the structure" 
seemed like a symphony score. Another theme, "collaboration and teamwork" 
showed the necessity for having staff (musicians) collaboration and 
cohesiveness. The expert nurses identified a fourth theme of "going beyond" or 
knowing what to do besides playing the written notes. A final theme was 
"maintaining excellence through training and education." Nurse administrators 
can use these findings to design environments which facilitate giving quality 
care.
