Ethnicity Within Orem's General Theory of Nursing: A Theoretical Analysis and 
Research Example

Nancy O'Connor

In this paper, the contribution of Orem's General Theory of Nursing (GTN) to 
the understanding of sociocultural orientation as a factor which influences 
patient and nurse variables in the health care setting will be explored in a 
general theoretical sense. In addition, findings from a survey of 616 adults 
ages 19 through 70 who receive ambulatory health care from nurse practitioners 
will be reported as they relate to ethnicity as a predictor of specific sets 
of self-care capabilities. The sample was ethnically diverse with African, 
European, and Asian-Americans the predominant ethnic backgrounds reported. 
Findings demonstrated that ethnicity was a significant predictor of the 
foundational dispositions of self-care agency, but not of the power to perform 
the productive operations of self-care agency, using multiple regression 
techniques. Implications will be discussed in relation to the adequacy of the 
theory to describe and explain the importance of sociocultural variation in 
self-care research. Points of articulation between the theory and selected 
psychological theories of ethnic identity will be examined.
