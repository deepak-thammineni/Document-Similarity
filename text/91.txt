Ethical Decision-Making by Emergency Nurses

Marcia Bosek

Traditional ethical decision-making resources may not be useful in resolving 
ethical situations in the emergency department due to time limitations, lack 
of an established nurse-patient relationship, and incompetent patients. The 
purposes of this study are to a) identify the types of ethical situations 
experienced by emergency nurses, and b) describe and analyze the process used 
by emergency nurses when resolving an ethical situation. A grounded theory 
method was used since the ethical decision-making process used by emergency 
nurses is an unexplored phenomenon. Fourteen subjects were self-selected from 
a population of nurses employed in three midwest emergency departments. Each 
subject participated in a semi-structured, audio taped interview. Actions were 
taken to insure the trustworthiness of the data. Ethical situations 
experienced included: confidentiality, justice, aggressiveness of treatment, 
and informed consent. The Basic Social Psychological Process is autonomy. The 
Basic Social Structural Process is advocacy. A conceptual framework describing 
the nurses perception of the ethical situation will be presented. 
Recommendations for nurses and administrators will be discussed.
