Measuring the Impact of Reengineering on Patient Care Delivery

Barbara Pillar

In order to meet the demands of delivering quality health care in a time of 
cost containment, many hospitals have undertaken reengineering. Reengineering 
is defined as the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of processes to 
achieve dramatic improvements in critical and timely measures of performance. 
In an 800 bed, urban, acute care hospital, the effect of reengineering on 
patient outcomes is being evaluated through a two year prospective study of 
change in the structure of the hospital and in the processes of delivering 
care. Outcomes include 1) patient care methods, to be documented by new skill 
mix, roles, operations, support services, information systems; 2) standards of 
operation, to be documented by benchmarks; 3) authority and autonomy of the 
nurse, assessed through nurse survey; and 4) commitment to patient focused 
care, also surveyed through nurseself report. Quality of care will be 
evaluated by changes in length of stay, number of adverse events, patient 
satisfaction, physician satisfaction, nurse satisfaction, and Medicus quality 
measures. Efficiency will be measured by workload, productivity, and cost. 
Sampling for this repeated measures design links patients and nurses to allow 
measurement of change as roll out proceeds in the organization. This poster 
presentation will describe the development of the study design, methods, and 
data collection instruments. Baseline data and preliminary results will also 
be presented.
