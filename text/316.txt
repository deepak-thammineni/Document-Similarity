Case Study Research Methodology in Studing Marginalized Individuals and 
Communities: An Application of the Beyond Method Theory of Gareth Morgan

Norma Geddes

The case study research methodology lends itself to the study of marginalized 
individuals and communities as described by Hall, Stevens, Meleis (1994). In 
particular, the opportunity to let individuals participating in the research 
process both guide and edit the revelations of their lives, allows for rich 
detail and serendipitous discovery. Specific examples will be presented which 
illustrate the advantages of the case study method from the perspective of 
opportunities for discovery and opportunities for moving beyond method 
(Morgan, 1983). The ethical obligations of researching vulnerable, 
marginalized populations will also be explored. It is the thesis of this 
presentation that the researcher has a professional and implicitely moral 
commitment to participants engaged in study. The manifestations of this 
commitment are negotiated between the researcher and the participant.
