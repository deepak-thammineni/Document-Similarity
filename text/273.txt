Hope, Spirituality and Quality of Life of Non-Institutionalized Elderly

Sister Patricia Miller

There is a paucity of research on non-institutionalized elderly and strategies 
to promote their quality of life. The literature indicates that hope and 
spirituality are significant in the quality of life of persons with life 
threatening illness or death involvement. This study identifies the 
relationships between hope, spirituality and quality of life (QL) of 
non-institutionalized elderly. The sample was 75 persons over 65 years of age 
at five congregate meal sites for senior citizens. Subjects completed Oars 
Functional Assessment, Herth Hope Scale, Spiritual Perspective Scale (Reed), 
and Quality of Life Index (Ferras and Powers). Strong relationships 
(p<.01-p<.000) were found between hope and QL for Health, Socioeconomic, and 
Psychological/Spiritual dimensions. Spirituality was related it QL for the 
dimensions of Importance of Health and Satisfaction of Psychological/Spiritual 
dimensions (p<.04, p<.000). Hope and Spirituality were predictors for health 
(p<.000), Socioeconomic (p<.009), and Family (p<.032) dimensions of QL, with 
Hope the strongest predictor. Results indicate Hope and Spirituality be 
included in the strategies being developed and tested to promote QL for 
non-institutionalized elderly.
