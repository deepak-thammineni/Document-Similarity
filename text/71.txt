Caring for the Chronically Mentally Ill Patient in the Community: The 
Experience of Burden

Susan L. Jones

The purpose of this research is to describe the objective and subjective 
caregiver burden and situational contexts associated with caring for a family 
member or friend with chronic mental illness. The study design is a 
longitudinal, quasi-experimental study over three years. Over 150 caregivers 
are studied. These caregivers are asked about their relationship with the 
client, the illness of the client, and situations that are troublesome as well 
as those situations that are rewarding. Results show that the caregiver minds 
very little about the objective care required for the client but is bothered 
about the reaction of the client when the client is not pleased with the 
client-caregiver situation. The mental health system is used only in times of 
crisis. Caregiver burden is the major driving force influencing whether the 
mental health system is used and thus a decrease client hospitalizations. 
Policy implications are outlines considering the arrival of a managed care 
mental health system.
