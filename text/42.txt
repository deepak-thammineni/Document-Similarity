Development of a Visiting Contract in a Coronary Care Unit (CCU)

Linda L. Lazure

Patient-nurse-family visiting contracts have been shown to be effective in 
enhancing CCU patients' sense of personal control (Ziemann & Dracup, 1990; 
Brannon, Brady, & Gailey, 1990). The purpose of this study was to develop a 
patient-nurse-family visiting contract for use in future research based on the 
investigator's dissertation study of patient control of family visitation in 
the CCU. A collaboratively developed survey of CCU patient, family, and staff 
visitation preferences was distributed to 60 CCU patients, their families, 
and, CCU staff. Data were analyzed by the investigator and CCU staff and used 
to develop a "contract" which consisted of a series of interchangeable 
preference options printed on red, green, or yellow cards. The cards will be 
displayed outside the patient's door to inform potential visitors about the 
patient's visiting preferences in a subsequent study. It is hoped that this 
investigation will add to both nursing and medical knowledge.
