Returning to Work Post-Liver Transplant

Sarah E. Newton

Returning to work (RTW) is both an important behavioral outcome and an 
indication of an adult liver transplant recipient's attainment of maximum 
health post-transplant. With adult liver transplant (OLT) recipients' one-year 
survival rates exceeding 90 percent and the majority of them assessed as being 
physically able to work, there is a paucity of empirical data to explain why 
less than 30 percent of the adult OLT recipients ever RTW post-transplant. 
Some variables related to recipient RTW have been identified, but the amount 
of variance accounted for by them is less than 20 percent. The purpose of this 
retrospective survey is to explore adult OLT recipients beliefs' regarding RTW 
and to examine whether a model comprised of sense of coherence, hardiness, and 
conception of health has explanatory power for the phenomenon of adult OLT 
recipient RTW. The data will be collected via mailed survey from a sample of 
300 adult OLT recipients who received their transplants at a large midwestern 
medical center and who are at least six months post-transplant. In order to 
evaluate the theoretical model, it is anticipated that hierarchical multiple 
regression analysis will be the statistical technique utilized. The results of 
this investigation will help to explain the phenomenon of post-liver 
transplant recipient RTW as well as differences in the recipients 
post-transplant attainment of their maximum health potentials.
