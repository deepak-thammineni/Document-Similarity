Comparison of Two Solutions for Capping Peripheral Intravenous Lines in 
Infants

Sharon M. Graves

Many adult hospitals use normal saline for capping peripheral IV's as their 
standard practice. However, as with many aspects of care it cannot be assumed 
that this information was immediately transferable to children. The purpose of 
this study was to compare normal saline versus heparin solution to maintain 
patency of capped peripheral IVs in infants less than one year of age, 
including premature infants, with a 24 gauge catheter. The research questions 
were: 1. Is there a difference in length of duration between IVs that were 
capped with normal saline versus heparin? 2. Is there a difference between 
IV's capped with normal saline versus heparin in the incidence of phlebitis, 
clotting or infiltration? 3. Is there a differential effect of site of IV, 
patient weight types of medications, blood/blood products administration, 
capped with normal saline versus heparin? 4. Is there a difference in the cost 
of medication between the two solutions? The subjects were 31 preterm and full 
term infants. This is an experimental blinded study. A Pearson chi-square 
analysis compared the differences in clotting, infiltration or the incidence 
of phlebitis. Cross tabulations and frequency distributions were used to 
examine the variable of weight, type of medication or blood product infused an 
site placement. The first three hypotheses were supported. The 4th hypothesis 
was not supported.
