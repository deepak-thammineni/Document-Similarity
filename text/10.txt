With an estimated 182,000 women in the United States receiving a new diagnosis 
of breast cancer in 1995, follow-up care is of prime interest to health care 
professionals. While several researchers have reported the psychosocial impact 
of a cancer diagnosis, few have examined changing needs of women as the stage 
of the disease progresses. Explored in this descriptive study were the needs 
of women with a diagnosis of breast cancer in the following stages of their 
disease: newly diagnosed (n=55), receiving adjuvant therapy (n=53), stable 
disease (n= 85), or diagnosed with a recurrence (n=66). The Cancer 
Rehabilitation Evaluation System - Short Form (CARES-SF), Health Status 
Questionnaire (HSQ), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), along with a researcher 
developed questionnaire were completed by participants. Differences in needs 
were found in women in different stages of their disease process. Women 
diagnosed with recurrence experienced more difficulties than women in the 
other stages of the disease process. This research points to the significance 
of interventions aimed at addressing the adjustment needs of women with a 
diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer.
