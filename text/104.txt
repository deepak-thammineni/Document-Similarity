Use of Confirmatory Factor Analysis to Assess the Construct Validity of the 
Hospital Ethical Climate Survey

Linda L. Olson and Richard T. Campbell

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) enables researchers to operate from an 
underlying theoretical perspective by proposing and testing hypotheses about 
the underlying factor structure of an instrument. The Hospital Ethical Climate 
Survey (HECS) was based on a concept analysis, literature review, and the 
investigator's experience. Schneider's (1990) concept of types of 
organizational climate, and Brown's (1990) conditions for ethical reflection 
guided the research. The construct validity of this new measure was assessed 
by CFA using LISREL 7 procedures. The CFA models were based on a sample of 360 
Registered Nurses who completed a survey consisting of the HECS, the Integrity 
Audit, and a social desirability scale. The final CFA model consists of 26 
variables in 5 factors. The Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index was .95, indicating 
a goodfit of the model to the data. The subscales reflect nurses' perceptions 
of peers, patients, managers, hospital, and physicians. A measure of ethical 
climate can enable researchers to study the influence of the workplace on 
nurses' ethical practice.
