Ethical Issues Facing Nurse Practitioners in Nebraska

Mary T. Sincebaugh

Nurse practitioners (NPs) are at the forefront of today's primary health care, 
using advanced nursing practice in a variety of settings. The role of the NP, 
as primary care provider, is expanding in the state of Nebraska. The purpose 
of this descriptive study is to identify ethical issues facing NPs in this 
state. Only one other study detailed the ethical dilemmas confronted by NPs in 
primary care. Another study which included NPs in the sample, prioritized 
ethical issues but did not separate NP results from other nonphysician 
providers. In the current study investigating certified NPs in Nebraska, 86 
subjects were mailed two questionnaires, the Demographic Data Form (DDF), and 
the Moral Conflict Questionnaire (MCQ), adapted with permission from Sara Fry, 
PhD, RN, FAAN. The DDF requested demographic information, and the MCQ asked 
the NPs to describe moral (ethical) issues they have encountered. Forty 
responses to the MCQ were received. Verbatim transcriptions are being analyzed 
independently by the primary investigator and two experienced researchers. 
Based on content analysis, a matrix will be constructed to categorize the 
identified ethical issues. This study will add to the limited information 
available on ethical issues facing NPs in primary care practice. Interventions 
may be identified by examination of these issues.
