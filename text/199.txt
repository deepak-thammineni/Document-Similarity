Increasing Knowledge and Improving Attitudes of Health Care Providers 
Utilizing a Train-The-Trainer Model to Reach Rural Communities with 
Alzheimer's Education

Deborah Marks Conley and Betty G. Foster

Reaching rural communities with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) education is an NIA 
funded project aimed at increasing levels of knowledge and improving attitudes 
among targeted health care professionals, specifically nurses, working with 
individuals with dementia. Volunteer leaders in five regions identified 
professional nurses, nursing home administrators, and social workers for 
training. Two days of intensive training were completed utilizing a training 
manual developed by the two authors/trainers. Sessions included didactic, 
experiential, interactive and case studies. Trainers modeled proven teaching-
learning techniques and demonstrated use of the manual. Topical areas included 
adult teaching-learning principles, epidemiology of AD, communication 
techniques, planning therapeutic activities, management of challenging 
behaviors, end of life issues and caring for caregivers. Pre, post, and 3 
month post-post tests were administered (n=110). ANOVA results showed 
significant increases (p=.001) in knowledge and attitudes. As a result of 
training, > 500 professional and family caregivers have received inservices 
and community education programs. This model, used as a Gerontological nursing 
intervention, can increase knowledge and improve attitudes of nurses working 
with individuals who have dementia.
