Sibling Percpetions of Childhood Physical and Mental Chronic Illness: 
Secondary Analysis of Three Data Sets

Agatha M. Gallo, Sandra A. Faux, and John M. Rowe

The purpose of this analysis was to examine the perceptions of 6-16 year old 
siblings about their ill siblings' illness. Using a non-categorical approach, 
three sibling data sets were combined and analyzed using secondary 
interpretive analysis techniques. A combined sample of 96 participants was 
created from three studies: 42 siblings of children with cranialfacial and 
cardiac defects; 28 siblings of children with diabetes, asthma, and arthritis; 
and 24 siblings of children with a chronic psychiatric diagnosis. Similar 
semistructured interview guides were used in the three studies. Secondary 
analysis was done on the verbatim transcripts of the original interviews. 
Thematic analysis focused on the sibling's knowledge (diagnosis, treatment, 
timing of information), and communications among family members about the 
illness. The extent and quality of knowledge was found to be dependent on 
diagnosis, illness visibility, behavioral expression, and family communication 
patterns. Implications for nursing practice include assessment of sibling 
knowledge and development of age and diagnosis specific appropriate 
interventions.
