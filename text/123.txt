Critical Care Nurses Knowledge and Attitudes Toward the Near Death Experience

F. Wimbush, L. Bucher, T. Hardie, and E. Hayes
Many people who survive a near-fatal crisis report some variant of a 
phenomenon known as the near-death experience (NDE). This study examined 
nurses' knowledge about and attitude toward the NDE via a self-administered 
questionnaire which was distributed to 1,000 participants at a national 
critical care nursing conference. Six research questions exploring critical 
care nurses' interest, knowledge, attitudes and interventions related to 
clients reporting an NDE were addressed in this descriptive, correlational 
study. To assess for differences between those familiar and unfamiliar with 
NDE, t-tests, chi-square and Mann-Whitney rank sum tests were used. Findings 
indicated a high level of interest but minimal knowledge about the NDE by the 
providers most likely to care for a survivor of NDE. The majority of the 
respondents reported a belief in the phenomenon and a desire for educational 
programs about NDE. Further work is needed regarding nursing's role in this 
experience as well as developing research based, therapeutic interventions for 
this group of clients.
