Pediatric Critical Care Nurses' Beliefs, Attitude, and Clinical Practice 
Related to Pain Management in Critically Ill Children

Carol Pederson

Critically ill children experience pain from a number of sources. Nurses are 
responsible for pain management, thus it is important to examine their 
beliefs, attitude, and practice related to pain management. In this 
descriptive study, 26 pediatric critical care nurses responded to a 35-item 
survey. Results indicate that nurses learned about pain management from their 
basic nursing program (15%) and current work environment (85%). Sources that 
provided the basis for nurses' pain management strategies were patient 
assessment (96%), physician PRN orders (96%), nurses' verbal report from 
previous shift (92%), and patient/family request or suggestions (42%). 
Although 58% said that pain is managed well on their unit, 23% said that 
choral hydrate is often used to quiet children, rather than meet their 
psychological needs. Nurses who learned about pain management from their work 
environment disagreed more strongly that (a) children do not remember pain, 
r=.66, p<.001; (b) pain can always be measured objectively, r=.56, p=.001; and 
(c) children experience pain less intensely than adults do, r=.47, p=.008. 
Baccalaureate education correlated with (a) basing pain management strategies 
on information from journal articles, and (b) agreeing that pain management is 
not stressful, r=.47, p=.008. Implication include providing information to 
nurses.
