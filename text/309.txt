Identification of Professional Values in Institutional Philosophies of Nursing

Mary Jane Schank, D. Weis, and J. Ancona

A nursing philosophy represents the value system of the profession, providing 
direction for the practice of nursing and the development of the profession. 
The nursing administrator creates the climate of nursing practice by 
formalizing and operationalizing professional nursing values. The values are 
enumerated in a philosophy of nursing document from which priorities are set, 
standards developed, and resources allocated. The purpose of this study was to 
describe which values articulated in the ANA Code for Nurses (1985) were 
reflected in the philosophy of nursing documents of 10 health care 
institutions. The institutions ranged in size from 87 to 700 licensed beds. 
Content analysis was employed to identify value themes in the ANA Code for 
Nurses (1985). Each institutional philosophy was examined for the presence of 
these Code themes. A binary index was created to systematically record the 
presence or absence of the themes. The number of themes in each philosophy was 
enumerated according to the individual Code value statements. The philosophy 
documents were found to reflect Code values ranging from one statement in one 
philosophy to seven statements reflected in three philosophies. None of the 
philosophies contained themes reflecting all eleven Code statements. Every 
philosophy reflected the dignity and worth of individual humanness (Code 
statement #1). Code statement #10 (protecting the public) was not reflected in 
any philosophy.
