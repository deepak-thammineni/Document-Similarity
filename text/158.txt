Describing Vigor in Heart Failure: Use of the Cross-Case Matrix in Methods 
Triangulation

Joyce A. Fontana

Vigor and vitality scales have been included in several health status 
instruments. Capturing the essence of vigor requires supplementing scaled 
measurements of this mood with subjective, qualitative perspectives. In a 
study that combined quantitative and qualitative methods to study and analyze 
vigor data collected from people with heart failure, a cross-case matrix was 
used to facilitate triangulation and reconcile the dissonance between 
objective measures and the uniqueness of individual lived experiences. On-
going content analysis identified redundant themes and patterns of the 
personal perceptions of vigor described by 12 participants living with heart 
failure. Quantitative measures of vigor and health measured by the Vitality, 
Physical Functioning, General Health, and Mental Health scales of the SF-36 
Health Status Survey (Medical Outcomes Study); a vigor visual analogue scale; 
calculated average energy expenditures in planned exercise; age; gender; years 
living with heart failure; ejection fraction and measures of functional 
capacity were added to a matrix for each case. The matrix displayed the themes 
of the qualitative data and the relative contribution of the participant for 
each theme and provided the means to sort cases by variables of interest 
related to vigor in heart failure and compare and contrast their relationships 
to the qualitative themes.
