The Effect of a Therapy Dog on Socialization and Physiological Indicators of 
Stress in Residents on Alzheimer's Disease Special Care Units

Kathryn Batson, B. W. McCabe, and M. N. Baun

This study examined the effect of the presence of a therapy dog on 
socialization and physiological indicators of stress in individuals diagnosed 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased communication and relaxation in the 
presence of a companion dog have been reported in a variety of subjects. A 
within subjects, repeated measures experimental design was used to measure 
heart rate, blood pressure (Kendall), and skin temperature (YSI Tele-
Thermometer) every 2 minutes during 10-minute sessions with or without a dog 
present. Sessions were videotaped for later coding (Daubenmire et al., 1977). 
Frequency scores for smiles (t=2.33, p<.05), tactile contact (t=4.35, p<.01), 
looks (t=2.78, p<.05), physical warmth (t=4.35, p<.01), and praise (t=2.79, 
p<.01); and duration scores for smiles (t=3.30, p<.01), tactile contact 
(t=2.83, p<.01), looks (t=4.42, p<.01), and leans toward (t=2.08, p<.05) were 
significantly higher when the pet was present, but the physiological 
indicators were not. Findings suggest pets can serve as a useful intervention 
for increasing socialization for persons with AD.
