The Characteristics, Drug Use, and Program Participation of 221 Registered 
Nurses Referred to a Peer Assistance Program for Alcohol and Drug Problems

Judy Williams, L. Finke, and R. Stanley

Many states have established peer assistance programs to help chemically 
impaired nurses. Information about nurses referred to these program sis 
essential to program development and to the development of primary prevention 
strategies; however, little research has been done on nurses referred to these 
programs. The purpose of this descriptive study was to identify the nurse 
characteristics and other variables that were significantly related to nurses; 
participation in the program. Over three-quarters of the nurses used drugs. 
The highest percentage of nurses used narcotics. Over one-third of the nurses 
had diverted drugs for their own use. Thirty-nine percent (39%) of the nurses 
studied had been reported to the state board of nursing and 27% had received 
disciplinary action. Over half of the referred group successfully completed 
the peer assistance program. Marital status and referral source were 
significant indicators of program participation. Nurses who were married and 
nurses who were referred by a health care provider, such as a physician or 
counselor, were more apt to have graduated from the program. Additional 
research is needed to develop assistance programs and prevention strategies.
