Does Contraction of Pelvic Floor Preparatory to a Cough Reduce Urine Leakage 
in Stress Incontinent Women?

Janis M. Miller

Healthy pelvic floor muscles (PFM), reacting to physical stressors such as a 
cough, provide a solid floor of support under the urethra. While numerous 
studies report the effects of PFM exercise as a therapeutic modality for 
stress incontinence, no studies could be found that report the effects of 
volitional control within an actual activity that precipitates leakage. The 
purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of PFM "knack" (contracting 
the PFM muscles simultaneously with a cough regardless of PFM strength) on 
urine leakage. The sample consists of 20 women age > 60. A simple test of 
leakage was developed- namely to hold a paper towel under the urethra during 
cough with a full bladder and repeat with PFM contracted. The amount of 
leakage is quantified by measuring the major and minor diameters of the wet 
spot on the towel. Preliminary results (N=10): For a medium cough reduction in 
leakage with cocontraction of PFM averaged 95% over no cocontraction (P=0.02, 
paired-t). For a deep cough, the corresponding change was a 70% reduction in 
leakage (P=0.04). Findings have significance for the approximately 33% of 
women who leak urine.
