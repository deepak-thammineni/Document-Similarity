A Comparison of Grief Responses Among Professional Women

M.E. Allen and B. Fischer

The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in the female grief 
experience between nurses and certified public accountants within two years 
after the death of a parent or grandparent. Using the Grief Experience 
Inventory developed by Sanders, Mauger and Strong (1985), data were collected 
from a convenience sample of nurses and accountants (n=50). Data for the 
groups on the nine subscales of despair, anger/hostility, guilt, social 
isolation, loss of control, rumination, depersonalization, somatization and 
death anxiety were analyzed using the Spearman Rho, Mann-Whitney in Test and 
MANOVA. These data with content analyses related to feelings since the death 
and now, influence of identified profession on the grief response and 
subseguent family expectations during the bereavement, will be presented.
