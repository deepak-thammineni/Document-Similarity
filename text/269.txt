Psychometric Characteristics of an Adolescent Oral Contraceptive Belief Scale

Kathleen M. Hanna

A methodological study was conducted to develop a female adolescent oral 
contraceptive belief scale. A 42 item scale representing the constructs of 
perceived benefits and barriers was developed based upon qualitative data and 
review by adolescent experts and adolescents. The scale was voluntarily 
completed by 407 female adolescents (15 to 22 years of age) from family 
planning clinics. Item analysis (inter-item correlations, item to total 
correlations and contribution to alpha coefficient) was conducted and 18 items 
were deleted. Maximum likelihood factor analysis with varimax rotation yielded 
2 barrier factors (relationship oriented and oral contraceptive regimen 
barriers) and 4 benefit factors (relationship oriented, pregnancy prevention 
related to self, pregnancy prevention related to others, and personal 
responsibility benefits). The 6 factors accounted for 53% of variance. The 
alpha coefficients ranged from .71 to .87. The scale should be beneficial to 
further research on adolescents' oral contraceptive beliefs and use.
