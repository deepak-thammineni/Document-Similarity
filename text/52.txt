Construct Validity of Two Instruments for Geriatric Depression: A Factor 
Analytic Investigation

Lisa L. Onega

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of the 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and the Dementia Mood Assessment 
Scale (DMAS) in assessing community-dwelling elders for depression. 
Conceptually meaningful factor structures were identified for the HRSD and the 
DMAS in a primary sample of 206 community-dwelling elders and in replication 
subsamples. The primary HRSD factor analysis using quartimax rotation 
accounted for 57.7% of the variance. The factors were retained. Depressed 
Affect, Vegetative Symptoms, Anxiety, and Agitation/Insight.  The primary DMAS 
factor analysis using varimax rotation accounted for 63.2% of the variance. 
The following five factors were retained: Depressed Affect, Environmental 
Interaction, Daily Patterns, Agitation/Suspiciousness, and Somatic Indicators.

The comparison of the factor structures of these instruments yielded new 
insights into their value as corroborative instruments in assessing geriatric 
depression and clarified differential components of geriatric depression as 
assessed by the HRSD and the DMAS. The findings of this research served both 
to improve clinicians' ability to assess geriatric depression using the HRSD 
and the DMAS and to more precisely define geriatric depression based on the 
derived factor structures of these two instruments.
