A Three Year Longitudinal Study Comparing Factors Influencing Psychosocial 
Adjustment to Cardiomyopathy

M. H. Frost, A. W. Kelly, D. Mangan, and K. Zarling

Similarities and differences in person-environmental relationships, 
appraisals, and coping strategies of 50 adults categorized into groups of more 
effectively and less effectively adjusting were explored and compared to 
previous years' data. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) conception of coping as a 
process guided this descriptive study. A combination of qualitative and 
quantitative methods were used. The Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale, 
Self-Report Version, was used to categorize individuals into categories of 
more and less effectively adjusting. Other instruments include the Ways of 
Coping Questionnaire, Meaning of Illness Questionnaire and a semi-structured 
interview. Interview data was analyzed for common themes. MANOVA was used to 
determine differences in appraisals and coping strategies between individuals 
more effectively and less effectively adjusting; multiple regression was used 
to determine significant predictors of psychosocial adjustment. Year three 
follow-up data will be compared with that from years one and two. Data 
analysis is currently being completed. Results will provide useful information 
for developing nursing care aimed at enhancing adjustment to cardiomyopathy.
