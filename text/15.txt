Asthma Self-Care Education with African-American School Children

Asthma is a chronic condition that affects 5-10% or about 4 million children 
in the country. Morbidity and rising mortality rates are of particilar concern 
in minority children. This study proposes to address a serious knowledge 
deficit about self-care management of asthma in minority children by testing 
the effect of a school-based asthma program on health and self-care on 8-12 
year old inner city students. Relationships in Orem's Self-Care Deficit Theory 
of Nursing will also be tested. It is hypothesized that: (1) self-care 
capabilities and self-care practice scores will be higher and that health 
measures will be significantly better after participation and at 2 weeks, 6 
and 12 months than before; and (2) that self-care capabilities and self-care 
practice scores will be higher and health measures will be signifiacantly 
better for a cohort that completes the program than for a similar cohort 
waiting to begin the program. Data from 120 students from eight schools will 
be obtained using measures of demographics, self-care capabilities, asthma 
self-care practices, and health. MANCOVA and multiple regression analyses will 
be used to test the hypotheses.
