Documenting the Contributions of Research to an Indian Community

Sharol Jacobson, Deborah Booton-Hiser, Kay Edwards, and Sue Pryor

A common complaint of Indian communities is that researchers fail to share 
findings with them or contribute in practical ways to the community. 
("Research is all take from us and no give.") This methodological paper will 
describe ways in which we planned in advance to contribute to the community, 
promote positive research-community relations, and forestall this complaint 
during a study of diabetes representations of Muskoke (Mus-ko-kee) Indians. 
The nature/contents and usefulness of participation in community life, use of 
meaningful incentives, diaries of helpful activities by project staff, health 
fairs at two community sites, events, and times, posters for community centers 
that emphasized both findings and benefits, and cost estimates of services 
rendered to the community will be described. Such strategies that are 
culturally congruent with the community can foster enormous good will for 
subsequent studies.
