Stress Appraisal, Self-Esteem and Perceived Control Among Adult Males

K. Renee Twibell

Stress appraisals of threat and challenge are associated with health outcomes 
in Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory of stress and coping. Psychometrically 
sound measures of threat and challenge appraisal are necessary to predict 
health outcomes in persons who face stressful situations. Evidence exists to 
support reliability of the BT Challenge Instrument (BTCI) and the Moneyham 
Threat Index (MTI). Construct validity of the two instruments has been 
examined by factor analysis. Further assessment of construct validity is 
needed to support the use of the instruments in nursing studies of 
stress-related variables. The purpose of the study is to examine the construct 
validity of the BTCI and MTI by comparison of scores on the instruments with 
scores on known measures of related variables. Lazarus and Folkman propose 
that stress appraisals are related to perceptions of self-esteem and perceived 
control. Therefore, the study tests the relationship between challenge 
appraisal, threat appraisal, self-esteem and locus of control in a sample of 
adult males (n=16O). Quantitative measures were completed anonymously. Data 
analysis includes Pearson r correlations, ANOVA, and an examination of 
age-related differences in scores. Results may offer further support for the 
validity of two measures of stress appraisal, which nurses may use to predict 
health outcomes and evaluate effectiveness of strategies. In addition, the 
results may refute or support tenets of Lazarus and Folkman's theory.
