Ethical Dilemmas in Clinical Nursing Research

Teresa J. Dossey

Advancements in nursing practice are derived from the research of expert 
practitioners. Thus, advanced practice nurses have a professional 
responsibility to participate in research and many take an active role in 
clinical research studies.

This presentation will describe case studies that exemplify some of the 
complex ethical issues advanced practice nurses may encounter within the 
clinical research setting. These situations occurred during a 
pharmaco-therapeutic clincial research project involving a high-risk 
obstetrical population. Various ethical issues emerged during the course of 
the research, including conflicts with autonomy, justice, beneficence, and 
nonmaleficence. In addition, appropriate ethical considerations in these cases 
were confounded by the presence of a second individual--the fetus.

While obstetrics is a specialized field with unique patient care situations, 
the ethical issues that arise when advanced practice nurses are involved in 
clinical research are universal. Numerous problems arise in dealing with 
unpredictable human beings in the clincal setting that are not routinely 
discussed in research courses. The first conflict advanced practice nurses 
will often face is their role as a health care provider versus that of an 
objective research scientist. A systematic approach to the logical ordering of 
the facts, opinions, and values, is discussed within this complex scenario. 
Analysis is presented through the application of a case-based method of 
reasoned analysis.
