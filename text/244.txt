Parental Alcohol Use: An Interaction Study

Pat Jamerson

The effects of maternal alcohol use on fetal development have been well 
documented; however, less is known about outcomes associated with paternal use 
and even less about interaction effects if both paternal and maternal alcohol 
use are present. Yet, it is rare that a woman who drinks alcohol does not have 
a partner who also drinks alcohol. The purpose of this study is to explore the 
developmental outcomes using an animal model when maternal and/or paternal 
alcohol use occurs. Twenty male and twenty female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
randomly assigned to either exposure or non-exposure groups. Exposed males 
were gavage-fed alcohol daily for 60 days before breeding. Exposed females 
were gavage-fed alcohol on days 14 and 15 of gestation. Four treatment groups 
were compared: male treated/female non-treated, male treated/female treated, 
male non-treated/female treated, and male non-treated/female non-treated. 
Offspring outcome measures include litter size, birthweight, organ weights, 
negative geotaxis, hanging suspension, righting reflex, continuous corridor 
gait measurements, and right angle and figure-eight maze studies. Chi-square, 
MANOVA, and regression analyses will be conducted upon completion of data 
collection. Findings from this study will contribute information regarding 
prenatal maternal and/or paternal alcohol use and intrauterine fetal 
development.
