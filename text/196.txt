The Validation of a Causal Model of Hospital Staff Nurse Absenteeism

Kathryn L. Hope and Roma Lee Taunton

Absenteeism rates of hospital employees have risen over the last few years, 
placing a burden on cost, effectiveness, efficiency of the work force. 
However, a body of research that identifies factors contributing to nurse 
absenteeism is lacking. The purpose of this study was to validate a causal 
model of hospital staff registered nurse absenteeism.

The model was built on previous models (i.e., Steers and Rhodes, Brooke) and 
research findings reported in the literature. Within the model, 
characteristics of the individual, structural characteristics, and 
environmental characteristics were hypothesized to affect absenteeism directly 
or indirectly through the intervening variables of absence culture, job 
satisfaction, job involvement, and commitment. The convenience sample 
consisted of 422 full-time, staff registered nurses (64% response rate) 
employed in two acute care hospitals throughout the study period. The majority 
of predictor variables were assessed by questionnaires with established 
reliability and validity. Two absence measures (single-day absence and 
frequency of absence episodes) were collected over 12 months. Using, 
structural equation modeling analyses, major findings of the study were as 
follows: (a) the model was not validated, (b) absence culture was the major 
predictor of absenteeism, and (c) separate models emerged when hospitals were 
analyzed individually. The findings from this study support findings from a 
recent study that found causes of absenteeism to be hospital specific.
