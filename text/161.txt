Triangulation of Data Sources to Determine the Effects of the Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome Diagnostic Label on Services

Deborah J. Hess

The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the triangulation of data 
sources being used in a descriptive study of family members' perception of the 
accessibility of health and education services before and after the Fetal 
Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) diagnosis. FAS, caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol, 
is recognized as one of the leading known causes of mental retardation. The 
cognitive, behavioral, and developmental effects of FAS are becoming more well 
known and it is believed that early intervention will assist the child in 
reaching his/her full potential. It is important to determine if families view 
the FAS diagnostic label as a means of accessing services.

A semi-structured interview was used with ten adoptive and biological family 
members in a FAS support group. Audio tapes of these interviews were 
transcribed, subjected to content analysis, and interpreted to develop items 
for Likert-type scales. A questionnaire containing these scales will be 
distributed in a nationwide survey of randomly selected biological, foster, 
and adoptive family members of children suspected of identified with FAS. A 
focus group composed of the original ten family members will be used to assure 
fidelity of the instrument before distribution.
