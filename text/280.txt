Dimensions of Informal Caregiving: A Meta-Ethnographic Comparison of HIV, 
Cancer, and Alzheimer Caregivers

Nancy R. Reynolds and Angelo A. Alonzo

The synthesis of research findings across population groups is important to 
knowledge development, however, little research comparing informal caregiving 
illness types has been executed, in part, because a number of the published 
accounts are qualitative. A meta-ethnographic technique (Noblit and Hare, 
1988) was used in this study to provide a comparative synthesis of qualitative 
research concerning HIV, Cancer and Alzheimer caregivers.

Thirty published qualitative research reports were located using database and 
historical search methods. For each study, interpretive themes, methods, 
sample size, caregiver age, relationship to patient and other variables were 
systematically evaluated by three independent coders (inter-rater agreement = 
90%) and thematically analyzed.

Common themes as well as critical differences were distinguished. While 
caregiving was identified as stressful across the studies, salient sources of 
stress varied from one population group to another. Preliminary findings 
suggest that reported differences in caregiving population group experiences 
not only reflect differential responses to the patient biophysical illness 
experience, but also to socially constructed metaphors and cultural images of 
different illness entities.
