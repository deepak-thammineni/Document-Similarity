of Breast and Gynecological Cancers

The purpose of this in-progress study is to describe relationships among 
selected psychosocial variables (i.e., anxiety, body awareness, and social 
support), perceptions of prior early detection experiences, background 
characteristics, and women's participation in programs for the early detection 
of breast and gynecological cancers. The Cox Interaction Model of Client 
Health Behaviors (Cox, 1982) serves as the conceptual framework. A convenience 
sample of 200 women will be recruited from the community. Subjects will be 
interviewed using the following: Spielberger's Inventory (trait anxiety), Body 
Awareness Questionnaire (attentiveness to normal body processes), Early 
Detection Experiences Questionnaire (perceptions of early detection/screening 
experiences); Marlowe-Crowne Scale (social desirability); and a questionnaire 
to determine types and frequency of routine screening practices, family 
history of breast and gynecological cancers, and social support related to 
early detection/screening practices. The interview takes about 1 hour. 
Participants will be contacted by telephone at 6- and 12-months post-interview 
to determine participation in early screening/detection behaviors since the 
interview. Data will be analyzed by multiple regressions and content analysis. 
Results provide direction for development and testing of strategies designed 
for increasing women's participation in early detection programs.
