Use of Cold Therapy on Pain in the Total Knee Replacement (TKR) Patient

Joyce Crutchfield, L. Zimmerman, and S. Barnason

In addition to using medication for managing postoperative pain for the 
orthopaedic population, some clinicians are advocating the use of continuous 
cold therapy in the immediate postoperative period as a mechanism for 
decreasing pain. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the influence 
of cold therapy during the postoperative period for patients undergoing TKR. 
Twenty-eight subjects were randomly assigned to receive a constant cold 
machine (CCM) or the standard ice bag in the immediate postoperative period. 
Pain scores (as measured by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and numeric 
rating scale (NRS), were obtained on each of the subjects. The mean age was 
72, and the majority were female, Caucasian, married and retired. Descriptive 
statistics were employed and pain was evaluated by comparing day and night 
time pain. in addition there were some subjects who chose not to use the ice 
bag in day-time measures, pain in the CCM group was the only group which 
appeared to decrease over time and the other groups were inconsistent. 
However, for the night-time ratings, the CCM and ice bag groups appeared to 
have a gradual decrease in pain over time as compared to the group who 
received neither. A larger sample size is needed to more fully understand the 
use of different cold methods and their influence on day and night time pain.
