Appraisal, Coping and Adaptation in Women with Breast Cancer: A Multi-National 
Study

Shirley Moore, Renzo Zanotti, Geraldine McCarthy, Doris Modly, and Sandra 
Broughton

Although illness belief systems of cultures have been documented, few studies 
have addressed the influence of culture on a woman's appraisal, coping and 
adaptation processes to breast cancer. The purpose of this study, therefore, 
was to compare the coping and adaptation responses of women with breast cancer 
across several countries. A cross-sectional convenience sample of 60 women in 
each of the countries of Canada, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, and the USA newly 
diagnosed (< 120 days) with breast cancer were surveyed. Subjects' appraisal, 
coping, and adaptation were assessed using the following instruments: (1) 
Primary Appraisal Questionnaire, (2) Ways of Coping Scale (Folkman, Lazarus, 
Dunkel-Schetter, Delongis, & Gruen, 1986; Lazarus & Folkman, 1988) , and (3) 
Psychological Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS) (Derogates, 1986). All data 
have been collected and data analysis is in progress. Differences across 
countries in appraisal and coping strategies each will be assessed using 
Chi-square analysis. Differences in adaptation across countries will be 
examined using ANOVA. This study will elucidate the culture-relevant 
dimensions of coping with breast cancer and emphasizes a multicultural and 
international approach to a global health concern.
