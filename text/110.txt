An Ethnographic Study of the Family Health of Rural Appalachian Microsystems

Sharon A. Denham

As health care reform continues, the need to develop innovative care systems 
that are cost effective, competent, and coordinated for individuals and their 
families is a primary concern. Because health is a socially constructed 
phenomenon within the family unit, an understanding of the multiple family 
health determinants is critical. Although reference to family health is widely 
noted in the literature, clarity of the variables characterizing this concept 
are lacking. The purpose of this ethnography was to explore how families 
define and practice health. An ecological model serves as the conceptual 
foundation for describing the multiple embedded health determinants that 
comprise the definition and practice of family health. The subjects for the 
study were families with preschool children and community informants whose 
Appalachian heritage is strongly linked to a rural Southeastern Ohio county. 
The methods of participant observation, field notes, and taped interviews were 
used to gather the data. A complex system of coding was used to interpret the 
data and meet the study aims using multiple case study analysis. Findings from 
this study reflect sociodemographic variables, routine family behaviors, 
health knowledge, health beliefs, health practices, and ecological influences 
that affect the definition of family health. These findings warrant future 
research and provide a basis for studying the affect of mutiple health 
determinants on the family.
