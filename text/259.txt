What is the Relationship Between Personality Hardiness and Burnout in Army 
Reserve Nurses

Nancy M. Marchido

Kobasa's conceptualization of personality hardiness provided the theoretical 
framework examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship 
between personality hardiness (control, commitment, and challenge) and burnout 
in Army Reserve nurses. Data was obtained through a survey of forty Army 
Reserve nurses in the midwest area using Kobasa's Hardiness Scale and Jones' 
Staff Burnout Scale for Health Professionals. The subjects were primarily 
female (75%) and Caucasian (90%),with a bachelor of science degree or higher. 
A moderately strong inverse correlation was found (r=0.52, df=35, p<.001). The 
validity and reliability were supported, however, the dimension of challenge 
was not related to burnout. Control and commitment correlated with burnout 
(r=-.61, r=-.57 respectively). Findings suggest that personality hardiness 
provides a resistance source in the perception of adverse job stressors, thus 
the areas of health promotion, health maintenance and in disease prevention is 
important.
