The Lived Experience of Rural Nurses: A Phenomenological Study

Judith Billings, J. Benz, S. Field, and C. Hadenfeldt

Approximately 17 percent of the practicing nurses in the United States work in 
rural areas. Several authors have described rural nursing, yet a description 
of rural nursing as it is lived by the rural nurse has not been systematically 
examined. The purpose of this descriptive phenomenological study was to 
describe the practice of registered nurses who are employed in rural hospital 
settings of 25 acute care beds or less. A purposive sample of 15 rural nurses 
was obtained. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim, and 
subjected to descriptive phenomenological analysis using the methods developed 
by Colaizzi (Ornery, 1983).

Themes that emerged during analysis include: Diversity, Back-up, Relationships 
with coworkers, Dealing with the unexpected, and Caring for those you know. 
The nurses describe the diverse skills required in rural practice and what it 
is like to care for friends and neighbors. They reported "aloneness" and the 
necessity of having back-up help available to deal with the unexpected. 
Special relationships developed with coworkers.

An understanding of the unique challenges and difficulties facing rural nurses 
has implications for practice and education including the need for 
geographically accessible continuing education and the inclusion of rural 
content in nursing education programs.
