Arterial and Venous Oxygen Saturation Monitoring in Premature Infants - A 
Pilot Study

Shyang-Yun Pam K. Shiao, J. Gresky, and Y-J Chang

The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of a continuous 
monitoring system for venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and arterial oxygen 
saturation (SaO2), using new three-wavelength catheters for 10 premature 
infants during the first 5 days of life. Premature infants suffer from 
oxygenation problem, and there is a fine line between oxygen sufficiency and 
oxygen toxicity in the care of these infants. SvO2 with SaO2 may provide a 
better picture of oxygenation in these infants.

SvO2 and SaO2 will be monitored through umbilical catheter lines, additionally 
the pulse oximeter (SpO2) will be monitored peripherally. These measurements 
will be refereneed to a newly improved cooximeter in laboratory every 8 hours. 
The laboratory test will include the measurements on fetal hemoglobin levels 
to determine the accurate oxygen saturation levels. A repeated measures ANOVA 
will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the monitoring devices. Infants will 
be followed for their hospital outcomes. This study will be the first to 
include fetal hemoglobin levels in the measurement of oxygen saturation and to 
provide SvO2 in addition to SaO2 and SpO2 data in premature infants.
