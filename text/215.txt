Attitudes of Nurses Toward Adult Patients with Excessive Adiposity

Marjorie J. Culbertson

The purpose of this descriptive survey was to examine attitudes of registered 
nurses toward the personalities and lifestyles of obese adult patients and the 
management of their care. Symbolic interaction theory forms the framework for 
this study along wit integration of the concepts of attitude and obesity. 
Seventy-three registered nurses from a baccalaureate and a master of science 
in nursing program in northwestern Ohio participated in this study. Data were 
collected via two questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and 
inferential statistics. Findings revealed a strongly positive and 
statistically significant linear correlation (r=.72, p=.000) between nurses' 
attitudes toward personalities and lifestyles of obese patients and their 
attitudes toward management of their care. Registered nurses need to do a self 
assessment of the attitudes they possess toward obese adults, since these 
attitudes may influence the quality of care for obese patients.
