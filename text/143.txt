Determination of Cultural Equivalence for a Spanish Scale of Learned 
Resourcefulness

Jaclene A. Zauszniewski and Gloria A. Harman

The Hispanic population is increasing rapidly and there is a growing interest 
in promoting their physical and psychological health. Learned resourcefulness 
facilitates the acquisition of health-promoting behaviors and the skills which 
constitute it are measured by Rosenbaum's Self-Control Schedule (SCS). Since 
Spanish is the primary language for many Hispanics, this two-phase study 
examined the cultural equivalence and psychometric properties of a Spanish 
translation of the SCS. Phase one evaluated the content of original and 
back-translated SCS items and some discrepancies that reflected cultural 
differences were found. Phase two was a cross-sectional survey of a 
convenience sample of 30 bilingual persons who completed the SCS in English 
and Spanish. The analysis of English-Spanish item pairs showed similar 
responses for 97% of the item pairs Alpha coefficients for both scales were 
.85. Paired t-tests revealed no significant mean differences for 78% of the 
item pairs. Significant correlations between item pairs were found for 83% of 
the items. No items were consistently problematic which suggests the potential 
usefulness of the Spanish SCS. Further instrument development and psychometric 
study is recommended with larger samples of Hispanics.
