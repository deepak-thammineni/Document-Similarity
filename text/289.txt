Catch-Up Growth in Premature Infants: Concept Clarification and Criteria for 
Clinical Assessment

A better understanding of the concept of catch-up growth, regulating 
mechanisms, and means of evaluating it would aid nurses in more effectively 
supporting parents. In this study, catch-up growth was examined for 61 
premature infants (32 weeks or less gestational age at birth), all appropriate 
weight for gestational age with a history of lung disease. The extent to which 
the 22 infants weighing < 1000 g at birth and the 39 infants weighing at least 
1000 g at birth caught up in weight, length, and head circumference was 
examined through the first year, adjusting age for prematurity. Although some 
infants achieved 5th percentile growth, a frequently used catch-up growth 
criterion, this growth does not consider genetic potential and the infant's 
size relative to the family. The smallest infants were less likely to show 
catch-up growth, suggesting several potential regulating mechanisms. How the 
parents define catch-up growth and what they expect for their infant may be a 
factor in the efforts they make to support the infant's growth.
