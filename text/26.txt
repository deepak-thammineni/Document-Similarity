Testing a Community-Based Model for School Nurses to Use with Adult High 
School Dropouts

Janet S. Barnfather and David L. Ronis

Adult high school dropouts are an underserved and virtually overlooked 
population at risk for unhealthy, unproductive lives. School nurses working 
with this population in adult education programs have examined how important 
constructs in the Modeling and Role-Modeling (MRM) theory and paradigm can be 
utilized in a community-based causal model. This study examines three specific 
MRM constructs, psychosocial development, basic needs and adaptive potential, 
and the influence these constructs have on health. Adult high school dropouts 
(N=190) returning to school completed self-report questionnaires which were 
designed to measure the identified MRM constructs. Using structural equation 
modeling, the hypothesized causal model fit the data extremely well (normed 
fit index .94; non-normed fit index .95; and comparative fit .98). Overall the 
model accounted for 55% of the variance in health. Psychosocial development 
was the best predictor of health. The best predictors of health will be useful 
in the next phase of this research program which involves designing and 
testing interventions for school nurses wthat will be conducted within a 
community-based approach.
