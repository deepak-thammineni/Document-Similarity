PROBLEM. The project was designed to improve understanding of the following 
dimensions: organizational climate, professional practice climate, work 
satisfaction, professional nursing autonomy, and communication satisfaction. 
Prior to this study, most of the dimensions had not been studied 
longitudinally in one setting to determine sensitivity to organizational 
change.

SAMPLE. The approximately 1200 RN staff were sampled at seven data collection 
times from December 1990 to January 1995 with a 10-15% response rate each time 
yielding 1217 questionnaires.

METHODOLOGY. Psychometrically sound instruments were selected and printed in 
survey booklets. Data were collected each time in a single day at 4 one-hour 
sessions. Analysis was descriptive and inferential (eg. MANOVA, multiple 
regression) using SAS 6.0.

RESULTS. The work satisfaction dimensions show short-term response but 
organizational climate measures found sustained differences.

IMPLICATIONS. Decision making demands knowledge of the properties of the 
measurement to interpret findings.
