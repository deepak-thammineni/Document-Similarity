Preventive Nutrition and Prenatal Infant Care Outcomes

Bernadette Butler and K. Otero

Food products ingested and other elements used by the pregnant woman are known 
to effect patterns of growth and development in the embryo and fetus while in 
utero. A pilot study, of 100 subjects, to determine the effectiveness of the 
Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, was 
conducted in a large private urban community facility. Fifty non-WIC 
mother/infant dyads and fifty WIC mother/infant dyads were randomly selected 
in a retrospective chart review study. Preliminary results indicate a 
significant difference in the infants' birth weight. Implications may mean 
that a different manner of care for the WIC mother/infant dyads could increase 
infant birth weights as indicated by the non-WIC dyads.
