Family Functioning, Hardiness, and Quality of Life in Families with 
Developmentally Disables Adults

Sandra A. Faux and M. Ford-Gilboe

Little attention has been paid to families with developmentally disabled adult 
members. Within a ecological model of chronic family stress and adaptation 
(Kazak), 30 family members (parents or adult siblings) of developmentally 
disabled adults (age 21-48 years) completed the Feetham Family Functioning 
Survey (Feetham); the Family APGAR (Smilkstein); and the Family Hardiness 
Index (McCubbin, McCubbin, & Patterson). In addition, semistructured 
qualitative interviews were conducted; data were analyzed inductively using 
grounded theory strategies. The range of total scale scores fell within 
previously reported scores for families with chronically ill members. Total 
scale scores on the FFS, APGAR, and FHI were moderately correlated (r=.54-.64, 
p=.01), indicated that these instruments measured similar, although not 
identical, concepts. Convergence of the qualitative and quantitative family 
were analyzed to develop a beginning estimate of family quality of life as 
recommended by Knafl et al. The utility of the instruments for this unique 
family population will be discussed.
