Managing Breast Self-Examination (BSE): Women's Perceptions of Coping 
Strategies

Julia F. Houfek and Cecilia R. Barron

The purposes of this study were to describe (a) women's perceptions of BSE, 
(b) strategies used to cope with BSE, and (c) differences in strategies among 
women with repressive and nonrepressive coping styles. A self-regulation 
framework guided the study. A convenience sample of 47 women participated in a 
semi-structured interview about their BSE experiences. Data were coded using a 
priori categories and those that emerged from the data. Major themes 
identified were (a) emotions involved in BSE practice, (b) difficulties 
associated with BSE health-care providers to find abnormalities, and (c) 
coping strategies for BSE including normalizing BSE and minimizing the impact 
of BSE. Differences in BSE management were identified according to coping 
style. Information about coping strategies can be used to develop 
interventions to increase BSE frequency and proficiency. Implications for 
practice include incorporating coping strategies during BSE teaching to help 
women regulate negative emotions. Research is needed to determine outcomes of 
the reported BSE coping strategies.
