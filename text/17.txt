Child Pain: Mother's Competency in Pain Assessment, Knowledge of Pain in 
Children, and Perceived Ability to Manage Child Pain

Pati Pryor Huffman, Margo MacRobert, and Sheila Taylor Myers

Parental ability to perceive intensity of child pain is a component of pain 
management and, consequently, of parenting. As part of a larger descriptive 
investigation, the purpose of this study was to question associations between 
consistency in perception of pain between mother and child, the mothers' 
knowledge of child pain, and her perceived ability to manage the child's pain. 
Using a convenience sample (n=150) of 75 matched pairs of hospitalized 
children (3-18) and their mothers, pain intensity ratings (Wong-Baker Faces 
Scale) were collected independently from mother and child within a maximum 30 
minute time window. In face-to-face taped interviews, conducted by a clinical 
nurse specialist or pediatric nurse educator, mothers used a 4-point scale to 
show degree of agreement with 6 items concerning knowledge of child pain 
(Ferrell, et al) and their own ability to manage the child's pain. Chi-square 
established correlations between pain rating difference and knowledge of child 
pain and between rating difference and ability to manage pain. Clinical 
implications extend to potential nursing interventions for parental management 
of child pain.
