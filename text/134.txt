Nursing Strategies and Maternal/Fetal Outcomes in Prenatal Care

Sheila Taylor Myers and Paulette Burns

The study purpose was to describe relationships between elements of prenatal 
care and maternal/infant outcomes recorded in POPRAS formatted prenatal charts 
in 9 community clinics between 1988 and 1991. Historically, effectiveness of 
prenatal care used number of visits to indicate quality of care that reduced 
negative outcomes for women and infants. Yet which interventions contributed 
to the outcomes was not identified, information essential for service 
planning. Intent of this study was to identify specific care contributing to 
positive outcomes. Using a data base constructed from 3634 prenatal charts 
drawn by stratified random sampling, a subsample of 775 records with complete 
data for 6 client characteristics, 7 teaching/counseling strategies, and 4 
medical tests was created. Findings include disproportionate distribution of 
care and 7 logistic regression outcome models, explaining up to 76% of the 
outcome variability with significant teaching/counseling strategies. Models 
offer implications for planning distribution of care.
