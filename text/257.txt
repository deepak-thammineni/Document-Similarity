The Subculture of Agriculture and Preventive Health Care: Meeting Health Needs 
of Rural Men

Sandra J. Clarkson

American farmers should be recognized as subculture whose individual health 
behaviors may reflect values derived from the agrarian tradition. Community 
health nurses in rural farming communities require an understanding of the 
influence of the value system of this subculture on preventive health 
practice. A men's health screening clinic program was implemented in a rural 
north central Missouri agricultural county in which 25% of the population 
reside on a farm. Men from throughout the county were involved int eh program 
planning in an effort to make the program culturally sensitive to farmers and 
ensure participation. Fifty men age 35-82 received multidisciplinary 
comprehensive health screening that included testing specific for agricultural 
occupational illness. This study was a secondary analysis of participant 
responses on an evaluation questionnaire measuring consumer opinion of the 
men's health clinic. Analysis revealed a high degree of satisfaction with 
clinic services.
