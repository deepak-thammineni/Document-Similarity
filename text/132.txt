Comparison of Two Methods of Classifying Adequacy of Prenatal Care

Rachel F. Schiffman and Mildren A. Omar

Low income women are at particular risk for starting prenatal care late and/or 
not continuing with visits. The purpose is to compare a modification of the 
original Kessner Index with the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index 
(Kotelchuck, 1994). The research is grounded in King's theory of nursing where 
the pregnant woman and the health care provider come together for the purpose 
of providing prenatal care. The sample consists of 437 records of women from 
two comprehensive prenatal centers. More than 90% of the women at each site 
were Medicaid recipients. The women were on average 22 years of age; most were 
high school graduates, single and Caucasian. Similarities and differences in 
the classification of adequacy of care with each index will be described using 
cross tabulation and Chi Square. Sociodemographic characteristics and birth 
outcomes for each index will be compared. Correct information about the 
pattern of care, the characteristics and birth outcomes of the women in each 
category may assist health care providers in the planning of appropriate 
strategies for low income women to access and use prenatal care services.
