Multiple Authors in Nursing Research: Contributions and Concerns

Ann H. White, Nadine Coudret, and Cynthia Goodwin
Multiple authorship in nursing research has complex practical and ethical 
implications for the profession. The purpose of this descriptive study was to 
identify contributions of nurse authors to published multiauthored nursing 
research projects. Factors impacting authorship inclusion and sequencing were 
investigated, as well as problems, issues, and concerns about multiple 
authorship in nursing. A survey questionnaire was sent to 225 nurse first 
authors of articles in 15 nursing journals representing research, general, and 
specialty practice. Responses were received from 167 authors (75.1%). 
Respondents identified which authors made significant contributions to seven 
aspects of the project: (1) initial conception; (2) resources; (3) study 
design; (4) data collection; (5) data analysis and interpretation; (6) writing 
first draft; and (7) revising the article. Issues and concerns about decision-
making, authorship inclusion and sequencing, and authorship guidelines were 
identified. Data from this study will support the establishment of 
professional guidelines for multiple authorship in nursing.
