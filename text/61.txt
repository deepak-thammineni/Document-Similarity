Nursing Assistants' Perceptions of Sensory and Functional Limitations in 
Nursing Home Residents After a Simulated Learning Experience

Judith Murphy

The purpose of this study was to describe nursing assistants' perceptions of 
sensory and functional limitations in nursing home residents after a simulated 
learning experience. A convenience sample of seven (n=7) nursing assistants 
representing day (2) and evening (5) shifts was selected from a 188 bed 
midwestern, suburban, skilled, not for profit nursing facility. Subjects 
participated in an hour long learning experience that simulated sensory and 
functional limitations such as: visual and hearing loss, immobility, painful, 
stiff joints, and tasting bland, pureed foods. Semi-structured interviews were 
conducted within three days following the simulated learning experience and 
again within 21 days. Interviews were audio and transcribed for analysis. Data 
were content analyzed and themes derived.

Results included a heightened awareness, and an increased sensitivity to 
sensory and functional limitations of nursing home residents. Subjects 
reported a change in their approach to residents who have functional 
limitations. All subjects recommended that such an exercise be included in the 
orientation or inservice programs for nursing assistants for both 
senstlization and learning. Implications for nursing administration address 
role development for the nursing assistant and orientation/inservice sessions 
which include this type of sensitivity training. Implications for nursing 
practice include issues of nursing assistant/licensed staff communication.
