The Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold (PLST) model is used extensively in 
planning and evaluating care for people with Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementing illnesses. While it has been tested in institutional settings, the 
model was developed for use by in-home caregivers. The National Caregivers 
Training Project is a 4 year multi-site study comparing family caregivers 
trained using the PLST model with those who received traditional information 
and support services. Caregivers were followed for one year.

Effectiveness of the model was evaluated using both quantitative and 
qualitative measures. Quantitative measures, collected at baseline, three, 
six, and twelve months, included instruments to measure caregiver mood states, 
depression, and knowledge of Alzheimer's disease. Instruments for care 
recipients measured function in activities of daily living, incidence of 
untoward behaviors, weight, sleep habits, and medication usage. Qualitative 
measures, collected at baseline and biweekly for six months, included 
caregiver interviews, daily behavior logs to record caregiver responses to 
untoward behavior, and perceptions of the research team during biweekly 
telephone contacts with caregivers. This symposium presents the first data 
analysis from the National Caregivers Training Project.
