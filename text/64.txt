Religiosity in Elderly Coping with Cancer

Chris Shaw, R. Fehring, and J. Miller

The purpose of this research was to determine the relationships among 
religiosity, spiritual well-being, hope, depression and other mood states in 
elderly persons coping with cancer. One hundred elderly persons (33 males and 
67 females) who had a diagnosis of cancer were purposely selected from the 
in-patient units of two large private hospitals. Using a religiosity index, a 
spiritual well-being scale (SWB), a geriatric depression scale (GDS) the 
Miller hope scale (MHS), and the profile of mood state scale (POMS) a 
consistent positive correlation between SWB and hope (r=0.75, p>0.01) and 
other positive mood states and a consistent significant positive correlation 
between intrinsic religiosity and hope (r=-0.57, p>0.01) and other positive 
mood states was found. Likewise, there was a consistent negative correlation 
between SWB and depression (r=-0.52, p>0.01) and other negative,mood states 
and between intrinsic religiosity and depression (r=-0.44, p>0.01) and other 
negative mood states. Analysis (ANOVA) also indicated significantly higher 
levels of hope and positive moods in those elderly with higher levels of SWB 
and intrinsic religiosity.
