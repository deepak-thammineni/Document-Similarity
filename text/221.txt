The Construction and Validation of the Developmental Scale of Sexual Risk-
Taking

DeAnn L. Ambroson

This cross-sectional exploratory study reports on the development of an 
instrument to measure college students' sexual behaviors, attitudes, 
perceptions of susceptibility to infection with HIV, and the influence of 
psychosocial developmental level on these variables. A convenience sample of 
422 undergraduate and graduate students was used to test the instrument. 
Aspects of Chickering's Theory of College Student Development meshed with 
Rosenstock's Health Belief Model provided the theoretical framework for the 
study. Factor analysis was used to identify four underlying developmental 
factors and four underlying sexual factors. Cronbach's Alpha ranged from.5 to 
.9 for these factors. The research hypothesis states that college students in 
earlier levels of development would tend to engage in high-risk sexual 
behavior more frequently but would be less likely to assess their behavior as 
increasing their susceptibility to infection with HIV than students who were 
more developmentally advanced. The hypothesis was tested using multiple 
regression analyses. The results of these analyses supported the research 
hypothesis that developmental level impacted sexual behaviors and perceptions 
of susceptibility to AIDS.
