A Phenomenological Study of Chronic Nonmalignant Pain

Angeline M. Gliniecki, Zxy-Yann Jane Lu, and Nori I. Komorita

Chronic nonmalignant pain is a poorly understood subjective phenomenon 
impacting millions of people. A phenomenological research approach attempts to 
provide an understanding of the meaning of lived experience. Such an 
understanding may reveal aspects of the experience unknown or misinterpreted 
by those who do not live it. This may lead to more effective treatments and 
improved quality of life, yet little phenomenological work was found in the 
literature on pain. The sample interviewed was solicited from the general 
population of a midwestern city and consisted of 4 men and 7 women, all 
Caucasian between 22 and 66 years old. Cause varied, but duration of pain 
ranged from 6 to 50 years. Analysis followed Colaizzi's method. Thirteen 
themes emerged from the data and 3 major concepts, loss of control, social 
support, and acceptance, were identified as important areas to be addressed in 
future work.
