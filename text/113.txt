Child Pain: Interventions Idnetified by Children in Pain, Their Mothers and 
Their Nurses

Sheila Taylor Myers and Margo McRobert

Assuming children experience pain they describe and know what changes that 
pain, the purpose of this research, part of a larger descriptive study, was 1) 
to develop an inventory of interventions used by children, their mothers, and 
their nurses and/or physicians and 2) contrast those interventions according 
to age and pain intensity. Using a convenience sample (n=255) of 75 sets of 
matched subjects (hospitalized child 3-18, the mother, and the 
nurse/physician), simultaneous but independent pain intensity ratings 
(Wong-Baker Faces Scale) were collected from each set member. In face-to-face 
interviews conducted by clinical nurse specialists or pediatric nurse 
educators, set members were asked what could be done to make the pain better. 
Using content analysis, inventories of pain interventions were developed for 
each set member and tested for correlations with age group and pain intensity 
using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Clinical implications include 
interventions to manage child pain.
