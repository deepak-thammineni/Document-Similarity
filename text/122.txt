Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Risk Factor as an Outcome Measure for the 
Cardiac Surgical Patient

Sue Barnason, L. Zimmerman, and J. Nieveen

Evaluation of patients following significant events such as cardiac surgery 
requires further exploration of the recovery trajectory so that methods which 
will maximize the outcomes of the patient (such as the development of clinical 
practice guidelines) and determine measures of quality in health care will be 
developed. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of cardiac 
surgery (coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery) on CAD risk factor 
reduction. Data were collected on 84 cardiac surgical patients whose age 
ranged from 36-83 years with a mean of 66 years. Subjects completed the 
Arizona Heart Test (AHT) prior to discharge, at 3, 6, and 12 months 
postoperatively. The AHT is comprised of 10 items designed to measure a 
persons risk for CAD, the female version has one additional item related to 
hormone status. A repeated measures ANOVA showed significantly lower CAD risk 
factor scores of baseline when compared at 3 months (F=14.22, p<.001), 6 
months (F=8.88, p<.01) and 12 months (F=8.12, p<.01). Significant differences 
were found for gender indicating women had lower CAD risk factor scores at 6 
and 12 months compared to males. Study findings support one measure which can 
be used in a comprehensive repertoire of outcome measure for this population.
