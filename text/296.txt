Assessment and Treatment Strategies for Acute Confusion Used in Iowa Veterans 
Affairs Facilities

James D. Waterman and Mary Kundrat

In order to determine current strategies used by nursing staff a 4 Iowa VA 
facilities to assess, prevent, and treat confusion as well as to identify the 
most pressing nursing management problems associated with acute confusion, an 
open-ended questionnaire was completed by 578 nursing staff members. Responses 
were clustered by obvious fit under appropriate codes from NANDA, Nursing 
Interventions Classification (NIC), ICD-9, and DSM-IV. Inter-rater reliability 
for coding was 80-96%. Common nursing care problems related to acute confusion 
included alteration in thought processes, at risk for violence and injury, and 
self-care deficit. Nervous disorders and electrolyte imbalance were the most 
frequently reported medical diagnoses. The most common assessment techniques 
were orientation checks and observation and only 11% used any published mental 
status exam for acute confusion. Interventions most frequently cited as 
effective were coping assistance, cognitive therapy, and communication 
enhancement. Ineffective interventions included reality orientation, poor 
communication, and physical and chemical restraints. This survey provided 
baseline data indicating that acute confusion is a major clinical problem for 
nursing staff at VA facilities, that there are numerous divergent views 
regarding its definition, and considerable ambiguity regarding its nursing 
management.
