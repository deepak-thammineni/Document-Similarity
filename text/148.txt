Responses of children to negative experiences present situations in which 
developmentally appropriate guidance is needed. On April 19, 1995, the 
Oklahoma City federal building was bombed killing 168 adults and children, 
injuring many others. In response, children sent expressions of thoughts and 
feelings to Children's Hospital of Oklahoma trying to communicate with victims 
and caregivers. The purpose of this study was to describe responses of 
children to a widely publicized disaster. Methodology consisted of thematic 
analysis of a sample of 300 communiques selected from 27 boxes containing over 
40,000 communiques from children. Purposeful sampling was conducted using the 
maximum variation sampling strategy. Analysis involved development of major 
themes: showing empathy, offering help, relating to own life, clarifying what 
happened, dwelling on violence, calling on religion, and wanting revenge. 
Content was also coded according to Kolhberg's moral development theory. 
Implications include better understanding of the responses of children to such 
a disaster, as related to psychosocial, cognitive and moral child 
developmental theories, and providing a basis for planning interventions and 
developing materials needed for parents and child care providers after 
disasters occur.
