Translation Technique: Rules and Issues for Translating Nursing 
Orders/Interventions to Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC)

Connie Delaney and Sue Moorhead

Nursing is straddling a faultline between the past and the information age. 
Present day incorporation of standardized nursing language into computerized 
nursing information systems gives nursing a new power to describe practice and 
determine its contribution to health care delivery. However, this strategy 
does not allow nursing to use clinical data stored prior to the development of 
standardized language. This thus obscures a comparison of the present with the 
past. The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast three diverse, 
independently developed methods for translating nursing orders/interventions 
into the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). Based on a synthesis of 
these methods, a technique for translating non-standardized nursing 
orders/interventions into the NIC will be presented. Decision rules and issues 
inherent within the rules will be discussed.
