Continuity of Care Research: Lessons Learned

Mary Ann Anderson, Mark Foreman, and Saundra Theis

Organizations providing care to elderly patients are greater in number and 
more highly specialized. The problems of continuity between organizations 
providing health care is much discussed, but rarely investigated. Continuity 
of care by definition has a time component, suggesting research methods 
employing a longitudinal approach. However, published studies are primarily 
cross-sectional in design. This study examined organizational transitions of 
elderly patients who had manifested an episode of acute confusion while 
hospitalized. Thirty patients were to have been enrolled and followed for six 
months, in order to generate interventions appropriate for improving care. 
Data collection involved medical record review, interviews of the identified 
patients, their families, primary nurses and other care providers, at several 
points in time. Unanticipated issues of research design as well as 
organizational and sociological dynamics of the rapidly changing health care 
delivery system, variables not well addressed in either the nursing research 
or continuity of care literatures, were problematic. This experience provides 
perspectives for designing future investigations of continuity of care with 
elderly patients.
