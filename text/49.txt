Suicidal Inpatients' Experience of Constant Observation

Carol Rogers Pitula and Rebecca Cardell

Protection is the presumed goal of constant observation (CO), the 
uninterrupted observation of inpatients to prevent suicide. However, there is 
controversy about who or what is being protected. Additionally, references to 
negative patient experiences such as loss of dignity and control appear in the 
clinical literature. Concerns about the limits and effectiveness of this 
intervention linger because of the lack of research. To understand the 
patient's perspective on the experience of constant observation (CO), seven 
male and seven female inpatients' responses to in-depth interviews about their 
perceptions of and reactions to CO were analyzed using a qualitative 
methodology. Participants responses were organized around two positive and one 
negative theme: physical protection, restoration of hope, and adverse effects. 
Participants reported that CO was beneficial not only because it preserved 
physical safety but also because interactions with staff restored hope. On the 
negative side, the absence of supportive interactions and frequent staff 
changes adversely affected the CO experience.
