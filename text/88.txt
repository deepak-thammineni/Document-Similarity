Longitudinal Analyses of Family Adaptation and Child Physiological Status in 
Families of Childien with Juvenile Diabetes

Empirical evidence about how families manage and adapt to the care of a child 
with a chronic illness has been steadily accumulating; however, much of this 
research has been cross sectional. The purpose of this study was to examine 
family adaptation and child physiological outcomes over time in 73 families 
who had a child under the age of 12 who had been diagnosed with juvenile 
diabetes for at least one year. The Resiliency Model of Family Stress, 
Adjustment, and Adaptation (McCubbin & McCubbin, 1993) was the theoretical 
framework for this investigation. Data on all Model variables (family demands, 
illness demands, family type using family hardiness, social support, 
appraisal, parental coping and family problem solving communication and the 
outcome of family adaptation) was obtained via independent self report from 
each parent in two-parent families at two points in time, one year apart. An 
average of three glycosolated hemoglobin readings (AIC) taken at the same time 
as family data collection was used for the child's physiological outcome 
variable. Descriptive data about the caregiving demands (time and difficulty) 
reported by mothers and fathers will be presented. Data analysis using 
repeated measures ANOVA and cluster analysis is in progress.
