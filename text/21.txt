Genogram Development to Assess Cardiovascular Risks in the School Aged Child

F. Wimbush and R. Peters

This pilot of one several in a longitudinal study to examine all risks related 
to cardiovascular disease in the same school-aged population. Family history 
of heart disease and increased risk is only 1 of 7 to be examined. The purpose 
of this study was to determine the ease of use of the Cardiovascular Genogram, 
one method of assessing the cardiovascular risk of the school-aged child. The 
instrument was pilot tested for content and ease of use with a structured 
interview and was found to be a valid and reliable method of obtaining a 
cardiovascular history for 3 generations. The risks have been categorized into 
primary, secondary and tertiary. Subjects are a convenience sample of the 
aprents of 100 5th and 6th grade students. Frequency tests will be used to 
determine the rate of return of the genogram. Percentages will report the 
number in each category. It is anticipated that the Parents' risk factors will 
be primary and secondary and that the next generation will be in all 3 
categories. We predict a return rate of 80% and that 75% of the families will 
have some cardiovascular risk factors.
