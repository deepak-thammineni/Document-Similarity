Imagery and Hypnosis to Reduce Pain and Anxiety Associated with Pediatric 
Surgery

Sally A. Lembert

Self-hypnosis, relaxation, and guided imagery have been shown to be beneficial 
in improving the postoperative course of adult surgical patients. Children and 
adolescents have successfully used guided imagery to significantly reduce the 
pain associated with invasive medical procedures. This presentation will 
explore the use of guided imagery and hypnosis as nursing interventions and 
synthesize research in the last decade as it relates to the pediatric patient 
with pain. The results of the author's investigation of the affects of guided 
imagery on the postoperatlve course of 52 children will be reviewed. This 
study demonstrated that the 26 children who learned imagery had significantly 
less pain postoperatively. Future research directions to examine guided 
imagery and hypnosis as nursing interventions will be identified.
