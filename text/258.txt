Urogenital Distress and Psychosocial Impact of Urinary Incontinence on Elderly 
Women

Martha S. Gallagher

Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common health deviation affecting millions of 
elderly women. The purpose of this research was to discern if a relationship 
existed between urogenital distress and psychosocial impact of UI on elderly 
women. The Roy Adaptation Model provided the conceptual basis for this study. 
Urogenital distress was evaluated using the Urogenital Distress Inventory with 
stress, irritative/discomfort, and obstructive subscales. Psychosocial impact 
was evaluated using the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire with travel, social 
relationships, physical activities, and emotional health subscales. Seventeen 
community-dwelling women over age 60 with UI at least once a week comprised 
the sample. A significant positive relationship was found between urogenital 
distress and psychosocial impact of UI (r=.68, p=.003). The negative 
psychosocial impact of UI on elderly women demands effective nursing 
interventions to promote optimal adaptation. Both the public and health 
professionals must be educated to enhance their awareness of the problem such 
that appropriate treatment is sought and provided.
