Sustained Effects of Relaxing Music on Heart Rate Variability Following Acute 
Myocardial Infarction

Jill M. White

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of death in the United 
States. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality in this population. Increased anxiety leads to 
increased sympathetic nervous system activation, resulting in decreased HRV. 
Studies have demonstrated that music therapy can elicit a relaxation response 
in those who have recently suffered AMI. Inducing a relaxation response may 
interrupt or reverse some of the deleterious effects of AMI by increasing 
vagal tone, thereby increasing HRV. Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory 
pilot study was to determine the effects of relaxing music on HRV following 
AMI.

Six newly diagnosed AMI patients were recruited for participation. Four hours 
of continuously recorded ECG data were collected for each subject. The ECG 
recording included 30 minutes of baseline data, a 20-minute music session, and 
approximately 3 hours of post-intervention data. These data were analyzed by 
means of power spectral analysis with fast Fourier transform. HRV increased by 
10.4% during the music session and peaked one hour after the intervention, 
reflecting a 32.4% increase. Baseline levels of HRV returned 1.75 hours after 
the music session concluded. Further study in this area may provide support 
for the use of relaxing music as a nursing intervention to increase HRV and 
reduce mortality and morbidity in the AMI population.
