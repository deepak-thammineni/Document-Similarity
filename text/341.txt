Ethical Dilemmas in Dealing with Cognitively Impaired Elders

Susan J. Barnes

This presentation discusses methods of assessing cognitive impairment in 
elders who may be asked to participate in research. Issues of informed 
consent, guardianship, and autonomy are important for the researcher to 
understand when dealing with a population that is vulnerable. Within the 
geriatric clinical setting, nurses frequently encounter patients who, although 
legally competent, appear to have their mental capacities compromised or 
undermined by illness, anxiety, or pain. On the other hand, individuals who 
have been ruled incompetent to handle routine matters in their daily lives, 
such as handling of their finances, my still retain the ability to make some 
limited decisions. These may or may not include decisions to participate in 
clinical research. It is therefore important for nurses engaged in such 
activities to be able to assess the mental capacity of these adults as an 
essential part of the informed consent process. Not only is this an ethical 
issue, it is also a moral obligation.

The Folstein Mini Mental State Exam is discussed as a screening tool to 
determine patient's mental status and ability to sign consent. The exam can be 
used to differentiate individuals who can sign consent for themselves and 
those who need a guardian's permission to participate in research activities.
