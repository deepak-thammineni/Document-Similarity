Treatment Decision Making for an Incapacitated Family Member: The Surrogate's 
Lived Experience

Brenda Recchia Jeffers

The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore the 
surrogate's lived experience during treatment decision making. A family member 
or legal guardian is expected to act as the surrogate decision maker for 
treatment decisions for an incapacitated family member. Little is known about 
the surrogate's lived experience during decision making. Past research has 
focused on the ability of teh surrogate to predict a family member's wishes 
regarding medical treatment and the type of decisions surrogate's make. The 
theoretical perspective of this study recognized nursing as a human science 
concerned with transpersonal human care (Watson, 1985). Snowball sampling was 
used to recruit participants, 11 of whom were included in the analysis. 
Additional sources of data were included, e.g. a videa documentary. Four major 
themes were identified that provided a pattern to the surrogate experience: 
Contextualizing; Standing by One's Self; Reviewing and Resolving; Gaining 
Strength and Peace. Knowledge of the surrogate's experience contributes to 
nursing's understanding of supportive caring practices and the meaning 
surrogacy has for family members.
