Caregiving: Cognitively Versus Physically Impaired Elders

Elaine T. Miller

Cost containment, early discharge, and expanding numbers of elders have 
triggfered concern for targeting health care interventions that assist 
caregivers of the cognitively and/or hysically imparied elder. Using symbolic 
interactionism and role theory as the theoretical underpinnings, this study 
investigated how the caregiving process, formal and informal service 
utilization, depression, and relationship quality differ for caregivers of 
cognitively versus physically impaired elders at home. A random sample of 28 
caregivers for severely physically impaired elders and 28 caregivers of 
cognitively elders participated. A combined qualitative and quantitative 
approach was employed that consisted of reliable and valid instruments and an 
interview guide that identified changes in the caregiving process across time. 
Data analysis revealed significant differences between the groups and 
relationships between selected variables. Qualitative findings revealed the 
importance of targeting specific nursing interventions for the elder and 
caregiver during critical times in the caregiving process and the need to 
develop more financially feasible resources. Legislative ramifications are 
also addressed.
