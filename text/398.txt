The specific aim of this research was to evolve a structural description of 
the phenomenon of living caring in everyday life. Participants, in a total of 
13 groups, were volunteers identified by word of mouth, and reflect a wide 
range of age, role and culture. The method, innovated for this study, was a 
group form of group Colaizzi-style phenomenology in which participants not 
only shared stories of their lived experiences of everyday caring but also 
evolved themes and metathemes from the stories. Data generation occurred over 
a three month period in small group natural settings, with one or two 
researchers and three to five research participants in each group. Initial 
synthesis was accomplished by research participants. After completion of all 
data generation, project researchers synthesized essential themes and the 
structural description of the phenomenon in a reflective group process. 
Essential themes were found to be: caring is evidenced by empathetic 
understanding action and patience on another's behalf; caring for one another 
by actions, words, and being there leads to happiness and touches the heart; 
caring is a giving of self while preserving the importance of self, and leads 
to fulfillment. A metatheme was evolved: everyday caring is giving of oneself 
on another's behalf. Implications include enrichment of the language of caring 
and enhancement of the foundation for studying caring in nursing situations.
