The Effect of Anticipatory Guidance on the Development of Stomatitis in 
Chemotherapy Patients

Lisa A. Davis

Stomatitis is one of the major side effects reported by cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy. The conceptual framework for this study is 
anticipatory guidance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether 
anticipatory guidance in a specific mouth care regimen leads to less severe 
stomatitis. A convenience sample of 28 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy 
were assigned by a toss of the coin method to either the experimental or 
control group. The experimental group received anticipatory guidance as well 
as supplies, and the control group did not. Degree of stomatitis was measured 
10-14 days after intervention both subjectively using the Modified McMaster 
University Questionnaire and objectively by the Western Consortium for Cancer 
Nursing Research Staging System for Stomatitis. Analysis revealed no 
difference in the two groups with regard to incidence or degree of stomatitis, 
but incidence was 7 (44%) in the control group as compared to 3 (25%) in the 
experimental. This has clinical significance. The results of this study is of 
interest to nursing because many times patients report dropping out of 
chemotherapy treatment because of the intolerable side effects.
