Infant Pain Behaviors: A Meta-Analysis of Research

Donna Miles Curry

Research on infant pain is often limited by the small sample size and 
restrictions dealing with a nonverbal sample. This study was conducted to 
examine existing research on infant pain with the goal of identifying 
behaviors which can assist nurses in assessing pain and the effects of 
interventions to mediate pain. Initially a sample of 62 studies from 
biological, medical, psychological and nursing research were examined and 
coded but after excluding studies that lacked appropriate statistics the final 
meta-analysis was conducted on only 14 studies. Effect size was computed for 
several variables. Difficulties in analysis were encountered over the 
numerous, more than 27, different variables used to measure pain and the 
different methods used to measure even common variables such as crying. 
Implications include the need for more research and better reporting by 
researchers of statistics to allow their research to be better integrated into 
more generalizable findings.
