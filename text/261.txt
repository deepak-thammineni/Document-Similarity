PURPOSE: To compare clinical & psychosocial parameters in two age groups of 
heart transplant (HT) pts at 6 months post-op.

RATIONALE: Previously, the age cut-off for HTs was 55; now pts as old as 70 
are getting new hearts, so it is imperative to examine how well the older pts 
do after HT.

SAMPLE: 175 pts at 6 months post-HT. Age range: 24-71; 26% > 60. Subjects were 
mainly male, white, & well educated, with no significant age differences in 
any demographics.

DATA: 10-year NIH study; two major medical centers.

TOOLS: HT Clinical Form, HT Symptom Scale, Sickness Impact Profile, Work 
History, Compliance Scale, HT Stressor Scale, Jalowiec Coping Scale, Quality 
of Life Index. Psychometric strength of all tools is well supported.

ANALYSIS: T-tests, chi square.

RESULTS: Main significant age differences: self-care ability, ambulation,work 
stress, coping. No significant age differences: heart function (eg: NYHA, 
LVEF, CO, CI); kidney function (creatinine, BUN); length of HT stay; symptoms; 
# of rejections, infections, complications; lipids; # of meds; % working; 
satisfaction with HT; quality of life.

CONCLUSIONS: In most clinical & psychosocial areas, pts > 60 did as well as 
younger pts at 6 months after HT. Heart function was comparable in both age 
groups.

IMPLICATIONS: Findings can help improve age decisions for HT eligibility.
