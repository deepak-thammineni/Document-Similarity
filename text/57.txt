Measurement of Two Forms of Resourcefulness in Healthy Elders

Jaclene A. Zauszniewski

The challenges and losses that accompany aging may alter task performance and 
self-care ability. However, resourceful elders maintain independence in daily 
tasks despite the presence of adverse situations. Resourcefulness consists of 
self-help strategies for coping with adversity. Yet, when faced by challenges 
or losses, elders may also seek help from others. This study examined 
self-help and help-seeking strategies in relation to self-assessed health, 
depressive cognitions, adaptive functioning, and life satisfaction among 150 
healthy elders. The results showed that self-help strategies were 
significantly correlated with the absence of depressive cognitions, adaptive 
functioning, and life satisfaction, and help-seeking behaviors were not. 
Neither of them were associated with self-assessed health. Self-help and 
help-seeking behaviors were not associated and of those subjects who scored 
high on self-help, those who were also help-seekers were not significantly 
different from those who were not. The findings suggest that healthy elders 
may benefit from interventions that facilitate self-help more than those that 
teach them to seek outside help. Future research should examine self-help and 
help-seeking strategies in elders whose physical or psychological health is 
compromised.
