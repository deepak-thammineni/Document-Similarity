Resources as Predictors of Health Outcomes in Midlife Women

Greer Glazer

Midlife has been overlooked in the study of the human lifecycle because of the 
dominant view that "nothing of interest takes place during this period of 
development" (Nolan, 1986, p. 51). However, a better understanding of the 
midlife period for women is particularly important because midlife women seem 
to be at high risk for life events which may negatively affect health. These 
life events put midlife women at risk for stress, depression and negative 
outcomes. The purpose of this research, which is part of a larger study, was 
to use Hobfoll's Conservation of Resources theory as a framework for studying 
predictors of anxiety, depression and health promoting activities. Hobfoll's 
theory predicts that stress occurs when people are threatened with the 
possibility of resource loss, when resource loss occurs, or when people fail 
to gain adequate resources following investment of resources. One hundred and 
twenty-nine midlife women were selected from a community based healthy group 
of midlife women via flyers, word of mouth, church groups, social 
organizations, high school parent-teacher associations, educational 
institutions, solicitation at shopping malls and employee contact at one large 
company. Multiple regression was used to analyze the data.
