Implementation of the Nursin Interventions Classification (NIC) in Five 
Clinical Sites

Joan K. Carter

The purpose of this investigation was to study the process of the 
implementation of the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) in five 
clinical sites. A prospective design was used to (a) determine the strategies 
and methods used to introduce the Classification, (b) idnetify the issues that 
emerged, and (c) provide guidelines that facilitate the smooth implementation 
organizations provided the conceptual framework for the study.

Using a qualitative approach and Ethnograph software, data collection methods 
for this 15 month study included audiotape recording of interviews of 
paticipatns at each site (86 interviews) over three time periods, participant 
observation of user group meetings, and analysis of all transactions of an 
electronic mail listserv for NIC users. The findings show that the 
communication channels and the leadership were key strategies for successful 
implementation. Participants fel that the use of NIC would increase both 
efficiency and effectiveness of care. Nurses' responses became more positive 
with more advanced stages of implementation. Results suggest the Rogers' model 
may need revision in the staging of the innovation process in that the present 
model suffers insufficient precision i its stage definition.
