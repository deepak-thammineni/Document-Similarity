Patterns of Parental Visitation to a Child in the Hospital

Congjit Saneha and JoAnne M. Youngblut

The purpose of this paper is to describe patterns of parents' visits to their 
hospitalized 3- to 8-year-old child and to identify factors related to these 
patterns. The convenience sample consisted of 26 mothers and 3 fathers of 29 
children admitted to the general care floor of a midwestern children's 
hospital. Parents completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale, a 24-
hour activity diary, and a questionnaire about transportation, cost, needs of 
other family members, and employment-related demands. Mean ages were 32.6 
(SD=7.48) years for parents and 5.4 (SD=1.65) years for the children; 23 
families (79%) had other children at home. 11 parents were employed. On the 
day of data collection, 14 parents stayed with the child continuously; the 
remaining parents spent an average of 9.9 hours with the child. Parents who 
stayed continuously reported lower trait anxiety, a decrease in personal 
hygiene and amount of alcohol consumed; they did not differ on state anxiety, 
education, number of other children, employment status, perceived severity of 
illness, ease of getting to the hospital, or distance from hospital, or 
children's anxiety scores. Implications for future research will be discussed.
