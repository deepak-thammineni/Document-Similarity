An infant's attention to toys during free play alone or with mother provides 
information about cognitive competence (Landry & Chapieski, 1988; Rose, 
Feldman & Wallace, 1992; Ruff & Lawson, 1991). A brief in-hom assessment of 
casual and focused attention to toys are healthy, term infants (n=53) and 
premature infants with either resolved acute or chronic lung disease (n=49) 
was administered at 8 months post-term age (PTA). The assessment included 
infant play with a set of toys (Alone) and with mother (Interact). The video-
taped session was coded in real time with a computerized system; inter-coder 
agreement averaged 72%. Focused attending for both Alone and Interact was 
related (p<.05) to the 12-month Bayley Mental Index (r=.24 and .23, 
respectively). Infants with chronic lung disease paid less attention to toys 
when alone but not with mother. The toy assessment offers nurses a way to 
explore infant learning from objects and response to maternal structuring of 
play.
