Quiet Behavioral State Predicts Successful Nipple Feeding in Preterm Infants

Gail C. McCain

The purpose of this research was to describe predictors of successful nipple 
feeding for preterm infants. Twenty preterm infants (M=34+1.8 weeks gestation; 
1,869+191 grams in weight) were observed during their first four nipple 
feedings. The Anderson Behavioral State Scale was used for observations. All 
feedings were given by the investigator to control for differences among 
multiple nurses' feeding technigues. Infants were fed per hospital policy at 
scheduled three hour intervals. Nine of the 20 infants were able to 
successfully nipple their first four nipple feedings (i.e. ingest the 
prescribed volume). The other 11 infants were unsuccessful in completion of 
the nipple feedings (i.e. They ingested some volume per nipple, and some was 
given per gavage). There were no differences between successful and 
non-successful feeders related to birth weight, post-conceptual age at birth, 
APGAR scores, sex, race, formula versus breast milk, and respiratory disease 
history. The nine successful feeders were more often in quiet awake behaviors 
states during feedings compared to the 11 non-successful feeders (t=2.4, 
p=.014). The unsuccessful feeders spent 59% of their feeding in sleep states 
compared to successful feeders who were in sleep states only 28% of their 
feeding time. Along with other research, these findings suggest that infant 
behavioral state is a predictor of feeding readiness and success.
