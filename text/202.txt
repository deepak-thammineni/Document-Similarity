The Interpretive Trail: Judging the Worth of Qualitative Research

Sharon L. Sims and Linda E. Musser

Judging the adequacy, quality, and worth of interpretive research continues to 
be problematic for scholars, editors, and funding agencies. While earlier 
attempts at establishing standards to evaluation have been useful, the 
standards produced have been limiting and often confusing. It has been 
difficult to move away from the language and intent of standards for 
evaluating experimental research. Even the most well-known sets of criteria 
seem quite analogous to ideas of reliability and validity. This paper proposes 
to move beyond this attachment and to begin construction of criteria that 
better reflect the spirit and philosophical basis of interpretive research. 
Concepts such as authenticity (core, theoretical, and philosophical), topical 
presence, participant affirmation and amplification, the interpretive trail, 
education of essences, and thematic congruence are described. This flexible 
and relational set of processes allows us to judge interpretive work in a more 
meaningful way.
