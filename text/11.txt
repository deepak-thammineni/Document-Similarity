Quality of Life of Women with Heart Failure

Susan J. Bennett and S. L. Baker

Little is known about quality of life (QOL) as experienced by women with heart 
failure (HF). The purpose of the exploratory study was to examine the role of 
illness symptoms, perceived health status, and social support on QOL among 
women with HF. The convenience sample consisted of 30 women hospitalized at a 
tertiary care medical center. The women completed five self-report 
instruments. Internal consistency reliabilities of the instruments ranged from 
.87 to .97. Symptoms of HF were significantly and negatively correlated with 
overall QOL (r=-.57, p <.01), while physical health status was positively 
associated with QOL (r=.62, p<.001). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated 
that only physical health status was a significant predictor of QOL. The 
results indicate that physical symptoms and physical health status were 
problems for these chronically ill women and that QOL was influenced by 
physical factors associated with their disease. A subsequent finding of the 
study suggests that the women represented a frail, vulnerable population who 
required special considerations during data collection.
