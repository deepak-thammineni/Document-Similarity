Three surface methods, Pleurimeter double inclinometer, Carpenter double 
inclinometer, and Sensor single inclinometer, were used to determine the 
magnitude of errors in measuring lumbar flexion. Thirty healthy volunteers 
were examined independently by three health professionals from an occupational 
health clinic. Each volunteer went through three stations to have lumbar 
flexion measurements taken using each method. The sequence was repeated. A 
radiograph was taken during the first sequence.

Results showed that (a) the validity of each method was low based on the 
radiographic measures, (b) intra-examiner reliability determined by 
intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was below .80 in eight situations 
and only one examiner using Pleurimeter achieved .901, (c) inter-examiner 
reliability determined by ICC was below .80 in all six situations, and (d) 
given a method, the examiner and its interaction terms possessed a large 
amount of variance based on the generalizability analysis. Further study is 
needed to compare surface and bone measurements.
