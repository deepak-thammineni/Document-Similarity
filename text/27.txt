A Comparison Between Sequential and Simultaneous Breast Pumping and Prolactin 
Levels

Pamela D. Hill, Jean C. Aldag, and Robert T. Chatterton

Mothers who must use milk expression techniques for a prolonged period 
frequently report decreasing milk volume over time. The purpose of this 
longitudinal pilot study was to compare the effects of sequential single vs 
simultaneous double breast pumping on milk volume and prolactin levels in 
mothers of preterm infants who mechanically expressed for a minimum of 5 weeks 
postpartum. Nine lactating mothers were randomly assigned to a sequential 
single or simultaneous double electric breast pumping system. Prolactin levels 
were measured in four mothers on days 21 and 42 postpartum. For the sequential 
single and simultaneous double groups, mean baseline prolactin levels were 
50.8 ng/ml and 40.6 ng/ml. respectively on day 21, and 26.6 ng/ml and 34.5 
ng/ml, respectively on day 42 postpartum. At 9 and 12 weeks postpartum, 
mothers were queried about their lactational status. The results suggested 
that milk yield may be maintained or increased with frequent use of the 
simultaneous double pumping system. Further study is needed to confirm results 
of this pilot study related to single vs double pumping and to determine if 
prolactin levels in mothers of preterm infants are similar to mothers of term 
infants.
