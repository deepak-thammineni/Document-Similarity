Personal Expenditures of Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy

K. Moore

The cost of health care is a significant barrier to prevention and treatment 
of illness and disease (Kronfeld, 1992). Most literature on costs discusses 
costs to the system for the delivery of care, yet personal expenses for 
catastrophic disease such as cancer can consume a family's entire resources. 
Seven percent of all hospital discharges in this country carry a primary 
diagnosis of cancer (Elixhauser, Andrews, & Fox, 1993). Subsequent costs may 
be conceptualized as direct and indirect (Clarke, 1993); human (Varricchio, 
1994); physical, instrumental, and administrative (Mor, 1987); or attitudinal, 
temporal, geographic, and financial (Bashshur, Homan, & Smith, 1994). The 
research question is: what are the types and magnitude of costs sustained by 
patients undergoing chemotherapy? Birenbaum's Cost Information Interview 
Schedule (Birenbaum & Clarke-Stefan, 1992) was administered to 30 adults 
receiving chemotherapy in an urban clinical setting. Items include cost 
categories of transportation, lodging, medications, supplies and equipment, 
child and elder care, home maintenance and repair services. Costs not covered 
by insurance will indicate which community resources would be of greatest 
benefit to the patient.
