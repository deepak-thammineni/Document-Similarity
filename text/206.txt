Explanatory Models of Illness Among Japanese

Mineko Yamashita

This study examined patients' understanding and responses to chronic illnesses 
in Japan. Two major research questions posed were: what explanatory models are 
used to describe chronic illnesses among Japanese? and what self-care 
practices of Japanese are engaged in during illness episodes? Explanatory 
models of illness delineated by Kleinman (1978, 1980) were the theoretical 
underpinning of this investigation. The methodological strategy applied was 
in-depth interviewing based on eight questions identified in Patient's Model 
(Kleinman, 1978, p. 256). Findings from the study were analyzed by 
quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings from this study have 
implications not only for local care providers in Japan but also for 
cosmopolitan care providers outside Japan. As well, self-care practices 
identified from this study may contribute towards the testing of Kleinman's 
theory, as well as Orem's (1983) Self-Care Deficit Theory in particular, since 
Orem's (1980) model indicates that self-care practices are culturally 
determined.
