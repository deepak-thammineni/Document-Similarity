Emergence: The Sacrificial Concept on the Alter of Mainstream Acceptability

Marsha H. Cohen

The assumptions of the naturalistic paradigm are appealing to many nurse 
researchers since they are most congruent with the professed values of the 
profession. Operationalized, these assumptions have yielded a wide variety of 
methodologies. Among these, grounded theory has recently been identified as, 
perhaps, the most commonly used interpretive strategy in the social sciences 
today (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994) and an unprecedented number of nursing studies 
that purport to have used grounded theory have been published during the past 
4 years. However, the capacity of researchers to discover significant, 
meaningful theory has been seriously diminished by the persistent and 
pervasive use of the dominant paradigm as the frame of reference to judge the 
merit of a proposed study. Established and new researchers alike have felt 
pressured to violate the concept of emergence in their proposals in exchange 
for enhanced funding opportunities or the timely and successful defense of 
their dissertation. This paper will discuss the concept of emergency and argue 
that it is the concept most critical to the scholarly conduct of every phase 
of grounded theory research and to the significance of the theory that is 
generated. Examples of how and why emergence is so often sacrificed will be 
explored along with strategies that may serve to reverse this 
counterproductive trend.
