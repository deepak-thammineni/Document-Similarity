Adherence to Standards of Care and Implications of Body Temperature 
Measurement in Trauma Patients

Wendy Sue Shreve

Trauma patients are at great risk for hypothermia and many treatment 
procedures in trauma care accentuate heat loss. Because of the potential 
dangers of hypothermia, it is essential to monitor the body temperature. The 
purposes of this study were 1) to identify the level of adherence to the 
standard that all trauma patients have body temperature recorded in the 
emergency department, 2) to describe the range of body temperature 
measurements recorded, 3) to identify the incidence of hypothermia and 4) to 
determine if a relationship exists between body temperature and injury 
severity. Orem's concept of nurse agency provided the theoretical basis for 
this study, a retrospective medical record review. A convenience sample of 60 
trauma patients was selected at a Level I trauma center. A 40% level of 
adherence to the standard for temperature measurement was found. Temperatures 
ranged from 87 degrees to 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and 33% of the patients 
were hypothermic (< 96.6 degrees Fahrenheit). A significant inverse 
relationship was found between body temperature and injury severity (r=-.46, p 
- .02). Findings from this research provide a basis for intervention studies 
and the impetus for educational programs to address the complication of 
hypothermia in this population.
