Pain Management in the Emergency Department

Gaile L. Nellett, Ching-Eng Wang, Patricia Hooper, and Dorothy M. Lanuza

Although pain is a symptom experienced by a majority of all patients admitted 
to the Emergency Department (ED), there is little information about pain 
management in this area. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive study was 
to examine ED pain management practice in a midwest university medical center, 
as determined by patient interviews just prior to discharge/transfer and chart 
audits. The Gate Control Theory was the conceptual framework used. Based on 
the previous year's ED admission patterns (i.e., days of the week and shifts), 
17 shifts were randomly and proportionally sampled. The convenience sample 
consisted of 129 patients (age 18 through 90, mean=47.7 years + SD 21.6; 53% 
females and 47% males) admitted with non-life threatening conditions and who 
experienced pain. The findings demonstrated that 94% of the patients were 
satisfied with their pain management. Yet while 64% had reported that an 
acceptable level of pain for them, on a scale of 0-10, would be a rating of 
less than 5, 35% reported their pain at more than 5 at the time of their 
interview. Documentation of systematic pain assessment was evident in only 5% 
of the charts audited. Therefore, intervention strategies are needed to 
improve pain assessment and treatment in the ED, as well as future research in 
that area.
