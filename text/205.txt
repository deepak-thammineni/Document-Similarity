Examining the Relevance of Modeling and Role-Modeling Theory and Paradigm 
Constructs for African American, Caucasian and Hispanic Adult High School 
Dropouts

Janet S. Barnfather

Adult high school dropouts are an underserved and virtually overlooked 
population at risk for unhealthy, unproductive lives. School nurses have 
recognized this at-risk population and are interested in examining 
community-based interventions that bridge the practice-research-theory gap. A 
school nurse practicing in an adult Career Education Center for adult high 
school dropouts conducted a study using major constructs from the Modeling and 
Role-Modeling (MRM) theory and paradigm. Specifically, this study examines 
three MRM constructs, psychosocial development, basic needs and adaptive 
potential. A convenience sample of African American (n=126), Caucasian (n=47) 
and Hispanic (n=11) adult high school dropouts at the Center completed 
self-report questionnaires which were designed to measure the identified MRM 
constructs. Although psychometric testing of these instruments has been 
reported in the empirical literature, there is a lack of testing for validity 
and reliability cross-culturally. The results of psychometric testing will be 
reported for students at the Center by culture/ethnic group. Subgroups within 
these groups will be examined related to identified MRM constructs. School 
nurses will use the results from this study to tailor a program of 
community-based interventions that facilitate culturally competent care.
