The Perimenopausal Experience in Physically Active Women - A Pilot Study

Suling Li

Perimenopause is defined as experiencing changes in menstrual pattern or no 
menstruation for three to eleven months. Little research exists regarding this 
perimenopausal experience in physically active women. This pilot study was 
undertaken to test tools currently available for measuring symptomatology and 
level of physical activity. A sample of 14 perimenopausal nursing faculty 
(mean age = 47 years; range 41-54 years) with varied levels of physical 
activity and at different stages of perimenopause completed the following 
tools: Women's Health Assessment Scale, Physical Activity Questionnaires 
(Current and Long-term), Health History Questionnaires, and Demographic 
Questionnaire. In the preliminary results, the most frequently reported 
symptoms were hot flashes, early morning wakening, forgetfulness, lack of 
energy and difficulty concentrating. Ratings for how bothersome each symptom 
is will be analyzed. Correlations between symptomatology, levels of physical 
activity and quality of life will be examined. These findings will provide the 
basis for further examination of any relationships between levels of physical 
activity and the experience of perimenopausal symptoms.
