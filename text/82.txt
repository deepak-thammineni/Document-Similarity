Health Effect's of Noise Annoyance in Factory Workers

While the effect of noise on hearing is well documented, effects on other body 
systems are less clear. Cardiovascular response to noise exposure has been 
frequently studied, typically within a framework of stress physiology, but 
findings are equivocal. One explanation for conflicting results is that the 
subjective perception of noise as stressful has greater influence than actual 
sound levels in producing stress. In this paper, relationships are examined 
among noise annoyance, noise levels, blood pressure (BP), pulse, and health 
symptoms in factory workers (n=398). Pulse and BP were measured during the 
administration of a survey of health history, health behavior, lifestyle, 
stress, and noise annoyance.

Noise annoyance (r=.23, p<.001) but not noise exposure was related to a sum 
score of health complaints as well as to several individual complaints, 
including chest pain, headaches, irreguIar heart rate, dizziness, fatigue, 
infections, and stomach problems (r=.13 to .29). Those reporting greater noise 
annoyance were more likely to use hearing protection (r=.19, p<.01) which in 
turn was related to lower systolic (r=-.12, p<.05) and diastolic BP (r=-.17, 
p<.01). The results of multiple regression analyses investigating the effects 
of demographic and psychosocial variables on BP, pulse, noise annoyance, and 
several specific health complaints will be reported.
