Cluster Analysis Replication of Variables in Highly Tempting and Slip Episodes 
of Individuals Attempting-Smoking Cessation

Monica Scheibmeir

Prior research on variables in highly tempting smoking situations using 
cluster analysis had supported a four cluster solution. A secondary data 
analysis was conducted to attempt replication of the cluster classification of 
variables in highly tempting and slip episodes of individuals attempting to 
quit smoking. Interviews from 66 subjects were used for the analysis. A 
modified version of Shiffman's coding scheme of situational variables was used 
to code the data. A hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward's method was 
performed followed by a K-means cluster analysis. A two cluster solution was 
obtained. The first cluster was labeled negative-stressful and the second 
cluster was labeled positive-social. A Chi-square test revealed that neither 
cluster was able to predict the outcome of the smoking crisis situation. 
Variations in sample size and setting may account for some of the difference 
between the two studies. Implications for cognitive and behavioral coping 
strategies are discussed.
