Effectiveness of an Education Program on Reduction of Physical Restraint Use 
for the Elderly

Sally J. Muich

The issue of restraint use and the elderly continues to be one of great 
concern. The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a 
formal education program as an intervention for restraint reduction in the 
care of the elderly. Lewin's theory of change and Knowles' androgogical model 
of adult learning formed the theoretical basis for this study. A convenience 
sample of 30 nursing staff members from a metropolitan hospital-based skilled 
nursing facility participated. A pro post test design was used. Participants 
attended three educational sessions which focused on restraint reduction. The 
post-test was given at the end of the third session. A chart review of 110 
charts from the skilled unit was conducted to determine the incidence of 
restraint use prior to and after the education sessions. Data were analyzed 
using descriptive statistics, & binomial version of the McNemar test - a 
Pearson Correlation coefficient. The results allowed a significant improvement 
in the test scores for knowledge and beliefs (p<.001). A significant 
correlation was found in the relationship of knowledge and beliefs. The data 
from the chart review showed a decrease in the use of restraints with an 
increase in the use of alternatives. The results indicate the importance of 
education in the effort to reduce restraint use and provide alternatives.
