Perceived Quality of Life of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Recipients

Pamela McCabe

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of death in North America. The 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been used to successfully 
treat individuals at risk for SCD. Morbidity and survival of ICD recipients 
have been widely studied, however, their quality of life (QOL) has been 
frequently studied. The purpose of this descriptive, longitudinal study was to 
describe the QOL of ICD recipients, and to explore the importance of QOL 
domains to ICD recipients. Ferrans (1990) conceptual model of QOL was the 
framework for this study. The Quality of Life Index-Cardiac Version (QLI-CV) 
was used to measure QOL. Part II of the QLI-CV was used to examine importance 
of QOL domains. Subjects (n=35) recruited from a midwestern tertiary care 
center completed the mailed questionnaires at one and six months after ICD 
implantation. Mean scores for the total QLI-CV and subscales were reported. No 
significant difference was found when one and six month total and subscale 
scores were compared by using a paired t-test QOL domains considered most 
important were related to family, health, symptoms, and spirituality. QLI-CV 
scores of this study's ICD recipients were found to be comparable to or higher 
than other cardiac subjects studied with the QLI-CV. Clinicians who counsel 
ICD recipients may find this information useful.
