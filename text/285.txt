Perceived Barriers to Breast Cancer Services, Perceived Control in Health, and 
Perceived Risks to Breast Cancer of African American Women

Barbara A. Fowler

PROBLEM: African American women suffer at a disproportionately higher 
incidence and experience poorer prognosis for breast cancer survival compared 
to Caucasian women and other minority groups.

PURPOSE: To test the reliability and validity of an unidimensional scale 
measuring perceived barriers to breast cancer services, perceived control in 
health, and perceived risks to breast cancer of urban African American women.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: The Health Belief Model and Health Locus of Control 
theory guided the study.

METHODOLOGY: Six experts reviewed the scale for content validity. Cronbach's 
alphas were used to determine internal consistency of the items. Factor 
analysis and Logistic regression were used to determine construct validity of 
the scale.

SAMPLE: N=104 African American women parishoners aged 40 and above. Half were 
married; most (98%) were under medical care of a physician; more than half 
(57%) received a mammogram during the last year; and most (98%) were referred 
by their physician for a mammogram.

RESULTS: Moderately high alphas were obtained on the subscales measuring 
perceived barriers to breast cancer services (.908) and perceived risks to 
breast cancer (.867). Factor analysis confirmed separate scales. Logistic 
Regression showed that barriers to breast cancer services predicted date of 
last mammogram (compliance) by a HCP (p<0.04).

IMPLICATIONS: Further research is warranted to identify barriers or other 
factors that may influence use of mammogram or clinical breast examination of 
African American women.
