Perceptions of Early Postpartum Discharge: Views of Nurses in Acute Care and 
Home Care

Patsy L. Ruchala and Dotti C. James

Maternity nurses, who have traditionally found their roles providing 
assessment, support, and teaching to new mothers and babies in acute care 
settings, now have less time for these activities during the shortened 
hospital stay. Using a phenomonological approach for inquiry, this study 
explores, from the perspective of nurses in both acute care and home care 
settings, the impact of early discharge on the nursing care provided to new 
mothers and babies. A random sample of nurses from both acute care (n=5) and 
home health (n=5) were interviewed. All participants were Registered Nurses 
and had at least two years of experience in providing nursing care to new 
mothers and babies. Audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim, and 
constant comparative analysis was used to identify recurring themes. Finding 
indicate that (a) there is a need for "transitional communication" between the 
acute care and home care settings; (b) nurses view early discharge as 
advantageous for neither nurses nor patients; and (c) nurses feel that it 
would be beneficial to implement postpartum teaching prenatally. The 
significance and implications for nursing include both the determination of 
essential nursing interventions and influencing health care policy for new 
mothers and babies.
