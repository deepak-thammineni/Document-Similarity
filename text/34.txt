Outcomes of Obstetric Early Discharge Interventions

Janice G. rustia, E. Gibbs, and N. Tourek

This is a report of a pilot study that is in progress. The purpose of the 
research is to determine the combination of nursing interventions that are 
most effective in facilitating parental dyad transition to parenthood 
following the birth of their first infant. The sample consists of 128 first-
time parents experiencing normal pregnancies and deliveries who deliver normal 
infants that meet the criteria for inclusion, and who are obtaining their 
obstetrical services at a local hospital. Equal samples of parents who either 
participated or did not participate in prenatal classes are being admitted to 
the study. A comparative design is being used in which the outcomes of a 
standard program of nursing interventions are compared with the outcomes of a 
modified program of nursing interventions. Multiple before and after 
intervention measures of outcome will be obtained, with data collection points 
transcending organizational boundaries, utilizing a core battery of 
instruments. Methods of analysis will include reliability assessments, 
descritpive statistics, and ANOVA's.
