Children with sickle cell disease experience considerable variability in the 
intensity and frequency of painful episodes, with most episodes managed at 
home. Little is known about their experiences. As part of a larger study, 46 
children, ages 6 to 12 years, from 2 Midwestern cities, completed daily pain 
diaries for seven weeks. Using the diary, children reported their pain 
intensity and location, pain management strategies, and school/social/home 
activities. Thirty-three (72%) of the children experienced pain every week. 
All required pharmacological interventions. Most children could attend school 
and other activities. Eight (17%) required contact with health care providers, 
and five (11%) were hospitalized. Positive relationships were found among pain 
reported, medication usage, and health care use. An inverse relationship was 
found between pain reports and activity. Several patterns of pain episodes 
emerged related to age and gender.
