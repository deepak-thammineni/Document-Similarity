Data Analysis with Partial Matching of Overlapping Samples

Patricia A. Martin and B. Mann

Problem. In longitudinal studies of organizations which use human subjects, 
subjects often turn over from one time period to another. Statistical 
methodology is available to correctly analyze such data if subject 
identifities can be tracked; however, confidentiality considerations can make 
such tracking difficult or impossible.

Sample. Data for the secondary analysis involved survey responses.

Methodology. Standard statistical methods for matched and unmatched data are 
reviewed and an example presented illustrating the gain in power using the 
correct analysis. These statistics are then modified to allow analysis in the 
case where only partial information is available on matches.

Results. Methodology is avialable for making proper adjustments when only 
partial matching is possible.

Implications. The results show the danger of ignoring the need to match 
individual responses for meaningful analysis and should encourage better 
coordination of organizational surveys.
