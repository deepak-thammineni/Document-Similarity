Nursing Informatics: Smoking Cessation and Pregnancy

Virginia Hill Rice, Paulette Hoyer, Farshad Fotouhi, and Melvern Ayers

Although client teaching has been mandated as a standard for professional 
nursing practice, issies surrounding what, when, where, and how clients should 
be taught continue. This nursing informatics' clinical trail uses an 
experimental pretest/posttest repeated-measures design to test the hypothesis 
that pregnant women in their first trimester given a new hypermedia 
interactive smoking cessation intervention program (HI-SCIP) will have: 
greater knowledge of the effects of smoking, higher quit rates, higher health 
status, and few low birthweight infants and premature deliveries compared to 
usual care (UC). Cox's Interaction Model for Client Health Behavior guides the 
study, HI-SCIP was designed to provide information on: health benefits of 
quitting, risks associated with continued smoking, 15 specific steps and 
strategies for quitting, signs and symptoms of cessation, how to avoid 
relapse, and indirect effects of the smoking of others on the expectant 
mother, fetus, and newborn using graphic structures where related nodes of 
information are connected by links. Nodes contain tests, icons, sound, film 
clips, and picutures. Pilot data from 60 subjects will be presented as well as 
a detailed description of the development of the project. Findings are 
expected to have far reaching consequences as other self-help, hypermedia 
informatics are developed to address other health problems and client needs 
for education in the current cost- and time-cutting health care environment.
