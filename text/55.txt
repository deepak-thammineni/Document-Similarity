Graphical Modeling to Uncover Hidden Relationships in a Multidimensional 
Problem

Sandra R. Edwardson and Katherine Dean

The availability of desktop computers capable of sophisticated statistical 
modeling can lead researchers to use methods to analyze data that fail to meet 
the assumptions of the methods. In a study of self-care behavior in an elderly 
popalation, a graphical interaction modeling technique (DIGRAM) was contrasted 
with more widely used statistical techniques. Graphical modeling, a subclass 
of log linear models, is capable of analyzing large contingency tables and 
permits examination of hypothesized patterns of associations and dependencies 
in a multidimensional problem. In contrast to multivariate regression 
modeling, the technique uses partial correlations and partial covariance 
structures. It does not assume that variables are continuous and normally 
distributed, a condition common in studies using psychosocial variables.

The method was applied to data gathered in face-to-face interviews with a 
sample of 608 elderly people living independently in the community. Subjects 
were asked to identify symptoms experienced in the prior month and responded 
to instruments evaluating the symptom experience, social support, and personal 
functioning. Findings suggest the importance of social connectedness and 
gender in making appropriate responses to common and potentially serious 
symptoms. Patterns of relationships were uncovered that may not be discerned 
by other more conventional analytic methods.
