Vulnerability, Defined and Experienced by Infertile Women, Within the Lazarus 
Stress and Coping Theory

Helen R. Hegna

Study identified the infertile treatment population's perception of 
vulnerability and created a vulnerability tool. Vulnerability, fit into the 
Lazarus Stress and Coping Theory, was applied. Questions: (1) How do women in 
treatment define vulnerability? and (2) do they experience it and what do they 
do as a result? Assumed that cognitive processes attached to emotions of 
fear-stress.

Infertility affects one in six couples and treatment may last years. Childless 
couples experience stress to bear children. Diagnosed infertile women who 
participate in treatment face uncertainty continually. Their cognitive 
perceptions that they may/may not become pregnant (threat to goal attainment) 
results in experiencing reactions of fear and ager. Studying stress and coping 
mechanisms profitable in assisting them.

For construction of the pilot instrument, five resolved infertile women, who 
identified with the populations's cognitive and emotional perceptions and 
reactions, were interviewed. Subsequently, the researcher developed 
Likert-type questionnaire was completed by six participants. The scale's 
Cronbach's alpha, above .70, indicated tool would describe and explain how 
these women defined and experienced vulnerability within the Lazarus 
framework.

Vulnerability was a negative feeling. Half felt vulnerable when starting 
infertility medications, others when menses began. All felt sad, most cried in 
isolation and some confided in significant other.
