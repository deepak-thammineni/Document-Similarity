A Study of the Relationship Between Registered Nurses Time Spent in Direct 
Care Activities, Nursing Skill Mix and Patient Perceptions of Nurse Caring

Jeanne L. Roode

There is a need for nurse administrators to understand how the use of nursing 
resources impacts the quality of patient care. A descriptional correlational 
research design was used to examine the relationship between RN time spent in 
direct care activities, nursing skill mix and patient perceptions of nurse 
caring. A secondary analysis was conducted using data previously collected as 
part of a large-scale data set from a 529 bed community teaching hospital. The 
data consisted of 76,491 activity samples obtained through work sampling of 16 
nursing units, 2 categories of unit skill mix measurements, and a Caring 
Behaviors Inventory completed by 313 patients. A significantly positive 
relationship was found between the percentage of time RNs spent in direct care 
activities and patient perceptions of nurse caring (r=.6874, p<.01). A 
significantly positive relationship was also found between the percentage of 
RNs in the skill mix and patient perceptions of nurse caring (r=.50, p<.05).
