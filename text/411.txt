Children's Development and Ethical Implications

Barbara Conrad

Many researchers fail to institute appropriate safeguards to protect children 
from exploitation. In fact, the record of research done on children has led 
Lederer and Grodin (1994) to conclude that, "The history of pediatric 
experimentation is largely one of child abuse" (p. 19). To some extent 
exploitation occurs because investigators are naive about the differences 
between adults and children and the additional precautions necessary to insure 
the protection of children's rights. This paper addresses ethical issues 
related to research with children. A developmental perspective provides the 
framework for discussing the inclusion of children in research. Justification 
for including children as subjects, research design implications, and human 
subjects safeguards specific to children are addressed.

An historical overview places the current status of research with children in 
context. Issues such as children's capacity to understand what is being asked 
of them, their ability to exercise their rights, and their vulnerability as 
participants in research studies are addressed. A survey of current research 
involving children provides the basis for elaborating the ethical issues 
specific to children as subjects.

A synthesis of research guidelines of several pediatric professional 
organizations provides the foundation for future recommendations. The paper 
concludes with a summary of the ethical issues that researchers and reviewers 
need to consider when a research design includes children as research 
subjects.
