Nurse Practitioner/Physician Collaborative Practice in Missouri: An Inside 
View

Sandra L. Stewart

Although the role of the nurse practitioner (NP) has been in existence for 
almost 30 years, there is no universal definition of that role and its 
relationship with the physician (MD) role in collaborative practice (CP). 
Collaboration requires determining a mutual goal, establishing an attitude of 
reciprocal respect and trust, and activating an environment of support and 
commitment through cooperation and assertion. To explore NP/MD CP, a survey 
tool addressing satisfaction and perceived proficiencies, barriers, settings, 
future directions,a nd regulation issues  was mailed to NPs in the state of 
Missouri. In addition, NP viewpoints regarding ideal and current CP practice 
were compared. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed using basic 
demographic data, Likert and rank-order scales, and a minimum of open-ended, 
short-answer questions. Essential findings, conclusions, and implications of 
this research are in the process of being obtained, and will be finalized for 
presentation at this conference. Due to the lack of primary care MDs and the 
increasing number of primary care NPs, it is vital that NP/MD CP be explored 
and evaluated to facilitate cost effective, high quality health care in the 
state of Missouri.
