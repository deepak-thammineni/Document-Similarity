The purposes in conducting this study were to describe (a) relationships 
between maternal-fetal attachment and pertinent demographic variables, and (b) 
the effect of ultrasonography and gravidity on maternal-fetal attachment. A 
convenience sample (N=63) consisting of midwestern women (20 primigravidas and 
43 multigravidas) experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies completed the 
Prenatal Maternal Attachment Scale. Bowlby's (1958) theiry of attachment and 
Rubin's (1984) pregnancy adaptation theory were utilized to guide this 
investiagtion. The results of a Spearman rho rorrelation indicated maternal-
fetal attachment was not significantly related to ultrasonography, 
intendedness of pregnancy, gravidity, educational level, income, maternal age, 
and marital status. The effect of ultrasonography and gravidity on maternal-
fetal attachment revealed no significant interaction effects. However, a t-
test for Prenatal Maternal Attachment Scale scores comparing primigravidas who 
received ultrasonography with those who did not receive ultrasonography ws 
significant; those primigravidas who recieved ultrasonography exhibited 
significantly higher attachment scores (t(9)=2.20; p=.04). Through 
ultrasonography, health care providers can be instrumental in fostering 
maternal attachment and awareness.
