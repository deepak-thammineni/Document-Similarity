Normalization: Reanalysis and Further Development of the Concept

Kathy Knafl, J. Deatrick, and C. Murphy Moore

Firsthand accounts, clinical observation, and numerous studies suggest that 
parents of children with chronic illness often strive to lead a normal family 
life in spite of their child's condition. Conceptualizing these efforts as 
normalization, researchers have identified cognitive and behavioral strategies 
used by parents to normalize family life (Knafl & Deatrick, 1986). Using the 
approach to concept development described by Morse (1995), the purpose of this 
paper is to further refine and develop the concept of normalization. Based on 
a comprehensive review of research-based and theoretical discussions of family 
response to childhood chronic conditions, the authors will verify abstract 
components of the concept that were identified in their original concept 
analysis of normalization (Knafl & Deatrick, 1986) and explore variations in 
how the concept is manifested across diverse family and illness situations.
