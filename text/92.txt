Interactive Processes Nurses Use in Ethical Decision-Making in Patient Care

Teresa A. Savage

The literature on ethical decision-making by nurses presents both prescriptive 
and descriptive decision-making models. The processes nurses use to move 
through the step-wise models have not been described. An atheoretical approach 
was taken using naturalistic inquiry methodology to explore the processes 
further. Eighteen nurses working in a midwest, urban academic medical center 
were interviewed. Analysis revealed that the nurses did not use the ethical 
decision-making models. The major themes of the interviews focused on the 
moral agency of nurses and the processes by which nurses accomplish their 
objectives for their patients. Physician-nurse relationships and their 
interactions were critical in the expression of moral agency of the nurses. 
The main finding in the sutdy ws that nurses' moral work is invisible. Their 
clinical decision-making, their negotation with others to meet their patients' 
needs, and their investment in their negotation with others to meet their 
patients' needs, and their investment in their patients' welfare virtually 
goes unrecognized and unacknowledged. Implications for nursing practice, 
education, and research will be presented.
