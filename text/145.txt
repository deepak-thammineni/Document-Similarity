Electronically-Monitored Oral Contraceptive Pill-Taking Among Women in 
Beijing, China

Rates of up to 60% for irregular pill-taking among women oral contraceptive 
(OC) pill users have been implicated in unintended pregnancy. In the U.S., 
electronically-augmented pill pack data have been compared with self-report 
daily calendars by Potter and Oakley. The electronic data, which records the 
time and date when pills are removed from the pack, show that women most 
likely to be irregular users are least likely to provide accurate self-report 
data. Therefore, the most accurate way to measure OC use is with 
electronically equipped packaging. In China OC users have especially high 
pregnancy rates. Therefore, a pilot test was undertaken with 5 women in the 
rural Beijing area to determine the feasibility of collecting electronic data 
to study the impact of quality of care, personal characteristics, and the 
policy environment on the quality of OC use. Data from use during October, 
November, and December 1995 will be presented. A case study format will be 
used to present the quantitative electronic and questionnaire data and the 
qualitative data from in-depth interviews. The process of collaboration 
between schools of nursing and public health in two countries will also be 
analyzed.
