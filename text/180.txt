Short stay (23 hour) patients have a variety of diagnoses and procedures 
performed, and an uncertain length of stay on nursing care units. Little data 
exist on the actual nursing care and staffing skill mix requirements for 23 
hour patients. As a result nursing care requirements for these patients can 
only be estimated when calculating the daily workload using traditional 
inpatient patient classification systems. This study identified a) the 
critical aspects of nursing care, b) the hours of nursing care required, and 
c) desirable nursing care giver skill mix for the short stay (23 hour) 
patient. Patients (N=200) within each of ten diagnostic categories were 
randomly selected from the daily patient census over a two month period at a 
large university medical center. Upon admission and discharge from the nursing 
care unit, patients were classified using the indicators from the Type VI 
Medicus Classification Tool. Interrater reliability was 90%. Nursing personnel 
assigned to patients were also asked to describe the care they were providing. 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient diagnostic categories, 
patient classification, the aspects of care, total hours of care required, and 
care giver skill level. Results will be utilized in determining nursing 
staffing decisions for the 23 hour patient.
