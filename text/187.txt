Child Pain: Behavioral Cues Used by Mothers and Nurses to Identify Pain In 
Children According to Pain Intensity and Age

Kathy Jost, Dianne Miller, and Carleeta Nelson

Ability to recognize behavioral cues indicating pain intensity in children is 
essential to pain management. However, age level and pain intensity amy alter 
this cuing and challenge the caregiver, whether parent or professional. As 
part of a larger descriptive study, the purpose of this research was to 
contrast cues used by mothers and nurses to assess pain in children of 
different ages experiencing various levels of pain intensity. Using a 
convenience sample (n=255) of 75 sets of matched subjects (hospitalized child 
3-18, the mother, and the nurse), simultaneous but independent pain intensity 
ratings (Wong-Baker Faces Scale) were collected from each set member. In face-
to-face interviews conducted by clinical nurse specialists or pediatric nurse 
educators, mothers and nurses were asked how they knew, or what data they 
used, to tell when the child was in pain. Given a list of cues published by 
AHCPR, they were asked also to prioritize cues. Using content analysis, cue 
inventories were identified and correlations between rank ordering according 
to pain intensity and age were tested using Spearman's rank correlation 
coefficient. Findings offer a predominant cue inventory by pain intensity 
level and age with priority differences ascribed to cues by mothers and 
nurses.
