The Experiences of Post Menopausal Women with Coronary Artery Disease

Linda A. LaCharity

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death among women and the 
incidence greatly increases after menopause. The purpose of this study was to 
gain insight into the experiences of post menopausal women after being 
diagnosed with CAD. The research was conducted from a feminist perspective, 
using audio taped in-depth interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, 
then coded and analyzed using the computer program, The Ethnograph, version 4. 
Analysis focused on four major themes derived from the data: effects of the 
diagnosis, life style changes, support systems and strategies for coping and 
adapting to CAD. Informants' comments suggested a model for understanding the 
complex inter-relationships of women's experiences with CAD. Insights gained 
from this research included the role of household duties during the recovery 
period, the importance of realistic rates of life style change, the relevance 
of compromise in decision making, the value of support systems, and the 
importance of coping and adapting with a diagnosis of CAD.
