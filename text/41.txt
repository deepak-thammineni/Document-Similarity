Alcohol Use During Pregnancy: Testing a Theory

Karen W. Budd and Greer Glazer

Although Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the only cause of mental retardation 
that can be prevented, there is a surprising lack of prenatal alcohol use 
theory that can be used to develop efficacious FAS prevention programs. 
Hypotheses of causal factors and relationships among factors must be tested. 
Using a case-control design, three groups of women (N=165) identified as 
alcohol users (cases), nonusers (controls), and never users (controls) are 
being selected at an inner-city prenatal clinic. Physical and psychosocial 
measures of variables known or theorized to be related to prenatal alcohol use 
are being administered. These variables are stress, self-coherence, self-care 
capacity, mastery, maternal self-concept, social support, coping, self-esteem, 
and maternal care capacity. Multivariate and path analyses will be employed to 
examine associations among the variables and prenatal alcohol use. Preliminary 
or final findings will be reported.
