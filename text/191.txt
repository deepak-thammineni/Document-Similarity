Nurses' Responses to Maternity Care Changes: Comparison Across Time

K. M. Stolte and S. T. Myers

This descriptive, longitudinal study strived to determine the changes 
maternity nurses changing to Single-Room Maternity Care (SRMC) experience. 
Peters (1987) chaos model was the framework. A convenience sample of 
experienced staff RNs from 4 hospitals was used. The Changes in Maternity Care 
Questionnaire (CMCQ) was administered prior to initiation of SRMC, but after 
completion of cross-training, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after SRMC began. The 
CMCQ addresses major changes, personal involvement, and perceptions of role 
and responsibility. Based on personal interviews, the CMCQ has content 
validity. Cronbach alphas for 3 subscales range from .64 to.93. Twenty-two 
(32%) nurses completed all 4 questionnaires. Descriptive statistics reveal 
most changes' impact were less positive throughout the study than at the 
outset. Cost containment, short stay and new environment change scores 
remained similar or slightly higher. Perception of self in professional role 
was significantly lower (p=.023) 3 months after SRMC began and never rose back 
to the original level.
