Mammography Utilization Among African-American Women

Mary de Meneses

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women. Implementation 
of nationwide mammography screening over the past two decades has coincided 
with an increased percentage of lower stage breast cancers diagnosed in this 
country. Screening mammography is currently the best method to detect early 
stage breast cancer. Mammography utilization varies significantly between 
racial and socioeconomic groups, with a lower rate for African-American women 
than Caucasians. A survey was used to define demographics, socioeconomic 
status, baseline mammography utilization, transportation, level of breast 
cancer knowledge, and presence of regular health care in older women from an 
African-American community. This correlational study identified why screening 
mammography services were not utilized by low-income African-American women. 
Analyses were descriptive for demographics and correlative for variables 
hypothesized as possible barriers. Findings indicate that most subjects 
believed prevention of cancer was an important reason for having a mammogram. 
Over three-fourths of the subjects had never had a mammogram. Reasons for not 
having a mammogram included: lack of finances, lack of transportation, and 
fear of pain.
