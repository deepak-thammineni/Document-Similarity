Triangulation: A Vehicle to Explore Caregiving Relationships

Elaine T. Miller

The demands of chronic illness and longterm care require that nurses 
continually expand their knowledge to maximize the delivery of health care in 
the home. As researchers struggle to understand the world of the chronically 
ill and their caregivers, the triangulation approach can offer an excellent 
vehicle to expand knowledge of this multifaceted relationship. This 
presentation describes how between method, investigator and data triangulation 
were operationalized in three related caregiving studies that had random 
samples. Focus areas in the research were relationship quality, communication, 
conflict resolution and other attributes affecting the outcome of caregiving 
relationships. Findings from the studies support the important contribution of 
triangulation to building nursing knowledge, but also the challenges presented 
by utilization of this technique.
