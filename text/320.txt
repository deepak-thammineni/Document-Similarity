Functional status is an important outcome measure after heart transplantation 
(HT). Predictors of functional status were examined in 190 patients who were 3 
months post HT at the University of Alabama Medical Center at Birmingham and 
Loyola University of Chicago Medical Center. Patients were 80% male, 87% 
white, 81% married, mean age = 53 years, 90% NYHA I and 14% working. Data were 
collected using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Rating Form, Jalowiec 
Coping Scale, Heart Transplant Symptom Checklist, Compliance with Heart 
Transplant Regimen, Social Support Index, HT Intervention Scale and Chart 
Review Form. The areas of greatest functional disability were work (95.8%) and 
eating (87.4%). Stepwise multiple regression demonstrated 6/19 variables as 
predictors of better functional ability 3 months after HT which explained 
51.4% of the variance (F=34.35, p=.0000). The predictors were less symptom 
distress, fewer infections and complications in the last 2 months, better 
ability to cope with the HT, less difficulty handling the HT regimen and 
shorter length of hospital stay for the HT. Identification of these predictors 
and areas of greatest disability allow health care providers to target 
problematic areas and intervene to achieve optimal functional status after 
heart transplantation.
