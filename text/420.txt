The specific aim of this study was to determine characteristics which 
distinguish abstinent from nonabstinent college students. Data were collected 
from students at 6 colleges/universities in the Atlanta metropolitan area. 
Names of students were randomly selected from registrar lists, and the 
selected students were sent a questionnaire to complete. Measures were derived 
from social cognitive theory and included knowledge of AIDS and safer sex 
practices, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, personal goals, perceived 
vulnerability and parental communication. A total of 2,069 students returned 
completed questionnaire. The majority of respondents were female (61.9%); 
49.1% were white, 38.9% black, 6.7% asian, and 5.4% of other ethnic 
backgrounds. There was an approximately equal distribution of freshman, 
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Preliminary analysis reveals that several 
social cognitive variables including general and sex-based communication with 
parents, self-evaluative outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, alcohol use, and 
perceived vulnerability were instrumental in differentiating sexually active 
from non-sexually active participants. The findings have implications for HIV 
prevention education for college students.
