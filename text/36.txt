Predictors of Quality of Life in Heart Failure

Quality of life (QOL) is a major concern in persons with heart failure (HF). 
Two measures of QOL are life satisfaction (LS) and activity. A sample of 38 
persons with HF was surveyed: 23 were managed medically, 8 were awaiting 
transplantation, and 7 were one month post-transplantation. The sample was 
predominately male (69%), married (76%), and caucasian (90%) with a mean age 
of 51 + 2 years. No differences were found among groups on the subjective and 
objective QOL variables; thus the three groups were combined for subsequent 
analyses. LS, as measured by the Index of Well-Being, was predicted by 
internal and external resources available [R2=.43, F=11.7, df 2,31, p<.0002]. 
Subjects reported that the availability of resources (111 + 3) exceeded their 
needs (107 + 4). Scores on the Human Activity Profile were predicted by 
symptoms as measured by the Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire [R2=.37, 
df 1,31, p<.05]. More importantly, left ventricular ejection traction (LVEF) 
did not enter into either regression model; furthermore, symptoms did not 
predict LS. These findings support placing more importance on the patient's 
reports rather than the objective measures like LVEF when assessing QOL. 
Furthermore, in the early period post-transplantation, there were no 
differences in LS, activity level, or resources needed and available. These 
subjects will be followed to examine differences over time.
