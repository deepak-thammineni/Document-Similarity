Burdens and Benefits: Dual Aspects of Genetic Knowledge

Janet K. Williams

The opportunity to learn about one's genetic make-up has increased with new 
knowledge generated by the Human Genome Project. This ongoing qualitative 
study describes the burdens and benefits of learning carrier status for adults 
with a positive family history of cystic fibrosls, Tay-Sachs disease, Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, or fragile-X syndrome. Semi-structured interviews were 
conducted in person or by telephone with 23 people from 16 families, prior to 
receiving results and one month after receiving results of screening. Content 
was analyzed to identify major themes. Prior to receiving results, themes 
shared by participants included: anticipating emotions, remembering family 
hardships associated with the condition, reproductive planning or undergoing 
testing on behalf of the children, and curiosity. After results were received 
benefits included: family planning, information for the children, emotional 
relief and satisfaction of curiosity. Burdens included emotional distress, 
family strain, and insurance worries. Study results suggest a need for 
recognition of the personal impact of genetic carrier knowledge and the need 
to identify effective mechanisms for assisting people to make decisions 
regarding disclosure of genetic information to family members and others.
