Spouse Influence on Patient Recovery Following Coronary Artery Bypass Graft 
(CABG) Surgery

Nancy T. Artinian

The purposes of this study were to: a) describe relationships among perceived 
spouse support behaviors, spouse anxiety, spouse coping styles and patient 
recovery following CABG surgery; and b) determine which spouse related 
variables are most predictive of patient recovery six weeks after hospital 
discharge. Family systems theory provided the theoretical basis for the study. 
The study used a descriptive longitudinal design. Data were collected from 121 
patient-spouse pairs at the following times: prior to hospital discharge and 
at one and six weeks afler discharge. Data were collected using eight reliable 
and valid instruments that were administered by interview and mail 
questionnaires. At six weeks, there were significant relationships between 
spouse anxiety and total patient dysfunction (r=.20, p=.05), patient 
depression (r=.32, p=.01), and level of patient symptoms, (r=.33, [=.01). 
Patient self-esteem was related to spouse support at 1 week (r=.17, p=.05) and 
6 weeks (r=.15, p=.05). Spouse support and spouse anxiety contributed varying 
amounts of variance to select aspects of recovery. Further study is needed 
before definite conclusions can be made. However, data suggest spouses and 
patients influence one another during recovery and support allocating 
resources to provide care to both patients and spouses after CABG surgery.
