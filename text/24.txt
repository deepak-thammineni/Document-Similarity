Research by Committee: A Study of Child Pain Used as Case Example of A 
Strategy to Develop a Clinical Research Environment

Margo MacRobert and Sheila Taylor Myers

The critical nature of a questioning environment for nursing practice has been 
clearly established but maintaining clinical research commitments are 
threatened in the face of recent downsizing and work redesign. "Research by 
Committee" is a strategy developed by a 120 bed acute care children's hospital 
to involve all level of nursing in critical questioning while examining 
clincial problems contributing to the CHO standard of care. This presentation 
will identify supports and barriers, strengths and weakness, and rewards and 
costs of the strategy used in this hospital.
