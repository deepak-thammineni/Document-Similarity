Getting Used To It: Older Persons' Management of Transition From Home to 
Retirement Home

Lois Roelofs and Kathleen Korthuis

Little has been reported on how older persons manage the transition from home 
to retirement home. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to analyze 
this process in older persons' description of the experience of living in a 
retirement home. Data were collected by participant observation activities 
within the home and intensive interviews of 40 theoretically sampled residents 
ranging in age from 66 to 94 years. Length of stay in the home ranged from 4 
months to 14 years. Interview data were analyzed using constant comparative 
method to develop coding categories. "Getting used to it" emerged as the basic 
social process which encompasses the strategies of continuing culture, 
relinquishing control, realizing freedom, reconciling disappointments, 
relinquishing amenities, savoring fellowship, and feeling joy. Results of this 
study provide useful information for nurses to anticipate issues they may 
encounter in providing holistic care to older persons who live in retirement 
homes.
