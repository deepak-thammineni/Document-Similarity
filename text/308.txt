The Ethics of Transforming Research into Story for the General Public

Susan Diemert Moch

Transforming qualitative research into easily readable story for the general 
public involves many ethical considerations. Human subject review for the 
research demands anonymity and confidentiality. The researcher guarantees such 
in the Consent Form. Yet, readable story involves detail, specifics and 
interesting quotes.

Ethical questions are discussed in light of research on breast cancer at 
midlife (Moch, 1990) becoming Breast Cancer: Twenty Women's Stories (1995). 
The book is a compilation of readable stories for consumption by the general 
public. Some of the important ethical questions surrounding the transformation 
from research to story include: "How much detail about participants can be 
included in the story?", "Should participants give permission before 
publication of the story?" and "Who gives permission if the participant dies 
before publication?"
