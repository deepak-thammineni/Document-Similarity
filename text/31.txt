FAmily-Provider Realtionships: Impact on Satisfaction with Care and Well-Being 
in Families with Children who have Down Syndrome

Marcia Van Riper

The purpose of this study was to explore links between parental perceptions of 
amily-provider relationships, satisfaction with care and well-being in 
families with children who have Down syndrome. Mailed questionnaires were used 
to collect data from 111 parents. A series of data analytic strategies (e.g., 
regression analyses, ANOVAs and a MANOVA) was employed to assess the data 
obtained. Overall, the results of this study suggest that when parents of 
children with Down syndrome have positive beliefs about family-provider 
relationships, tehy feel more satisfied with the care that their child is 
receiving. In addition, when a discrepancy exists between what parents want 
the family-provider relationship to be like and what they believe the 
relationship is like, parents feel less satisfied with the care that their 
child is recieving. Finally, the results suggest that when parents describe 
their family's relationship with health care providers as positive and family-
centered, they report higher levels of individual and family well-being.
