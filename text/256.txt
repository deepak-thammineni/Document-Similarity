The Relationship of Certification to Job Satisfaction, Autonomy, and Salary in 
Emergency Nurses

Corinne D. Wilhoit

With Stamps and Piedmonte's conception of job satisfaction as a framework, it 
was hypothesized that certified emergency nurses would report higher job 
satisfaction and autonomy than uncertified nurses and a salary increase as a 
result of certification. Reasons for seeking certification were also assessed. 
86 certified and 95 non-certified nurses completed the Index of Work 
Satisfaction (Stamps & Piedmonte) and questions on demographics and 
certification history. t-tests revealed that certified nurses had 
significantly higher total satisfaction, satisfaction with pay, and 
satisfaction with autonomy than non-certified nurses. 31.4% received a salary 
increase as a result of certification. The chief reasons for seeking 
certification were professional competence and personal satisfaction; barriers 
were cost, preparation time, and lack of perceived benefits. Employer 
promotion of certification should emphasize intrinsic benefits and provide 
some tangible support or reward for the effort.
