Over 50% of institutionalized elders have urinary incontinence (AHCPR 
Guidelines, 1992). A key component in planning treatment regimens is 
determining the type, patterns, and extent of incontinence. Twenty-four hour 
records are frequently used to obtain these data. As part of a larger study, 
data are being collected for three days at three points in time post-admission 
on 105 new nursing home admissions. This paper will examine correlations among 
the data obtained on three successive days, patterns that emerge over time, 
and difficulties encountered in obtaining accurate records. Correlations 
between the 24-hour recordings and incontinence noted on the Minimum Data Set 
(MDS) will be done. Recommendations about the number of days required to 
obtain valid and reliable data and strategies that promote accuracy will be 
made.
