Development and Validation of the Jenkins' Parent Apprehension Scale

Ruth L. Jenkins and V. Champion

Parental anxiety is a problem commonly cited for families in which an infant 
is being monitored for apnea or apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). 
Research to date has been descriptive in nature, and no quantifiable measures 
of anxiety specific to apnea of infancy and home cardiopulmonary monitoring 
are reported in the literature. Using a family resilency model and anxiety 
theory an instrument was developed to quantify the concept of apprehension in 
these parents. The Jenkins' Parent Apprehension Scale (JPAS), a summated 
20-item, Likert scale, was derived from the literature describing anxiety or 
upsets for parents. Content validity was established by six experts in the 
fields of nursing, medicine and psychology having knowledge of apnea, anxiety, 
and worry.

This study assessed the reliability and validity of the JPAS with 107 parents 
from a large midwest clinic. Through internal consistency reliability 
analysis, the coefficient on the remaining 10-Item Scale was 0.80.

Criterion-related validity was obtained with concurrent administration of the 
State/Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. 
Correlations for the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory were adequate for 
State-State (r=0.41, p<01) and low for the State-trait, (r=0.27, p<.01) and 
adequate for the Penn State (r=.33, p<.05). There is evidence that reliability 
and validity are adequate for clinical use.
