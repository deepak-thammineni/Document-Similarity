Family Acceptance of a Mental Illness Diagnosis: Japan and Midwestern US

Mineko Yamashita and Diane McNally Forsyth

The purpose of a secondary data analysis from two separate qualitative 
studies, one in Japan and the other in the midwestern U.S., was to explore the 
acceptance of a diagnosis of mental illness in an adult family member for 
family caregivers (total N=30). Despite differences in culture and theoretical 
approaches, the results of these studies were remarkably similar in terms of 
seeking information, concern about what others think, maintaining normalcy, 
and concern for the patient's management of care. One salient difference 
between the two samples was how families learned about the diagnosis. Nursing 
implications include how families' psychoeducation needs are met, especially 
during the initial stage of mental illness diagnosis.
