The Effects of Relaxation Breathing on COPD Patients in the Emergency 
Department

Marcia Bassity

With Benson's relaxation response as a theoretical framework, this 
experimental study assessed the effects of instruction in relaxation breathing 
on perceived anxiety, dyspnea, and oxygen saturation of COPD patients in the 
emergency department (ED). 14 patients were randomly assigned to receive 
instruction in slow chest breathing or standard care. Perceived anxiety and 
dyspnea were measured before and after treatment with visual analogue scales. 
Oxygen saturation was measured by pulse oximetry. Analyses of variance of main 
and simple effects by group and outcome were highly significant (F=9.5 to 
86.4, p=0.1 to .0009) in favor of the experimental group. The increases in 
oxygen saturation in the experimental group (M 3.4, SD 2.4) were clinically 
significant as well. If supported by further research teaching relaxation 
breathing to COPD patients is a simple, feasible, and effective intervention 
for ED nurses to perform.
