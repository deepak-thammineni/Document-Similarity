Sara Horton-Deutsch and C. Farran

Home health care is a type of community-based long term care that manages many 
of the elderly's post-hospital and chronic care needs. The management of 
medication use is a crucial component of home health care services that 
pervents rehospitalization or premature nursing home placement. The purpose of 
this study was to quantify medication use bypsychiatric home-based elderly 
patients. Participants were 65 years of age or older, on Medicare, and had a 
primary diagnosis of depression. One hundred eight charts were reviewed 
retrospectively beginning with those most recently discharged. The majority of 
patients were female 93 (86%). The average age was 78.6 years and the average 
length of stay was 78.5 days. The majority of patients were White 83 (77%), 
followed by Black 22 (20.4%), Hospanic 2 (1.9%), and Asian 1 (.9%). 76% of the 
patients were on antidepressants, 42% were on anti-anxiety agents and 30% were 
on antipsychotic. Few patients had a change in medication dosage (7%) and few 
patients had a change in time frequency (95%). the majority of patients were 
on 2 antidepressant medications (32.4%), followed by 1 (31%), 0 (18%) and 3 
(15.7%). 14 different types of antidepressant medications were prescribed: 40 
tricyclics, 38 SSRI's, and 4 MAOI's. Further prospective research will look at 
psychotropic medications effect on objective clinical outcomes.
