Effect of FAmily Focused Developmental Care on Mothers of Preterm Infants

Judith A. Heermann, K. Walburn, and L. Hall

Mothers of preterm infants in the NICU are unable to fulfill the expected 
maternal role lowering their maternal self-esteem and confidence (adaptation 
to mothering). This modifies their behavior and compromises infants' 
development. Evidence suggests Family Focused Developmental Cre (FFDC), based 
on the theory of synactive development, promotes satisfying patterns of 
communication and interaction between mother and infant which fosters maternal 
self-esteem and adaptation to mothering. The study's purpose is to test the 
effectiveness of an FFDC educational program in initiating nurse-provided FFDC 
in a NICU by measuring maternal sefl-esteem (Maternal Self-Report Inventory 
[MSI]) and adaptation to mothering (what Being The Parent of a New Baby is 
Like [WPL-R]). Subjects are 2 groups of 25 mother-infant dyads with infants 
27-34 wks. gestation, in the NICU for 28 days or more, and mothers who agree 
to visit infants weekly. Using a phase-lag design, phase 1 is following the 
control group receiving traditional care; phase 2 is the FFDC educational 
program presented to 8 nurses, and phase 3 is following the group receiving 
FFDC. Measures are demographics and MSI on entering study; WPL-R, MSI, and 
social support (SSS) at 1 mo.; and Neonatal Morbidity Scale (NMS). Differences 
between groups' MSI and WPL-R scores will be tested via ANCOVAs. Covariates 
will be SSS and NMS. Results will reveal whether the FFDC program is an 
efficient, effective, and feasible means of initiating such care.
