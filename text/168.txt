Handrail Support, Oxygen Uptake, and Heart Rate in Women During Submaximal 
Steptreadmill Exercise

The steptreadmill is a novel stairclimbing machine with 8 recirculating steps. 
The specific aim of this study was to determine oxygen uptake and heart rate 
response to three handrail support conditions in women with a history of high 
blood pressure during submaximal steptreadmill exercise. Fifteen subjects were 
randomly assigned to three handrail support conditions at step rates of 25 
steps/minute and 33 steps/minute. At 25 steps/minute, oxygen uptake and heart 
rate were significantly lower during both the five-finger and three-finger 
handrail support conditions heart were significantly lower during both the 
five-finger and three-finger handrail support conditions versus the no 
handrail support condition. Although these findings are preliminary, the no 
handrail support condition is recommended for sedentary women who begin an 
exercise program on the steptreadmill. However, if handrail support must be 
used for balance purposes, its effect on oxygen uptake and heart rate must be 
taken into consideration.
