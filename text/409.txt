Perceptions of Health in Elders

Sandra Hutto Faria

As the older adult population continues to increase, health promotion is a 
growing concern for health care professionals. An individual's perception of 
health plays a vital role in health teaching and health behaviors. The purpose 
of this descriptive study was to explore health as perceived by older adults. 
Interviews were conducted with approximately 30 elders to answer the 
questions: (A) "What does the term health status mean to you?", and (B) "Do 
you think you can control your health status?" A convenience sample of elders 
was obtained from various Elder Care Services programs in a city in the 
Southeastern United States.

Content Analysis of the interview data to elicit recurrent themes was done. 
Elders described health as being able "to do and to go" as they desire. They 
revealed that they can control their health by having adequeate exercise and 
food, staying active, and by maintaining a positive attitude. Ability to 
maintain their independence was the primary factor described which influenced 
whether they perceived themselves to be in good health or poor health. These 
findings indicate that elders perceive independece as being vital to good 
health. Therefore, recommendations for clinical practice include utilization 
of interventions which promote independece as much as possible. Guidance and 
support of independece in elders is important in order to enable them to 
improve their health status.
