Using the Braden Scale to Predict Pressure-Ulcer Risk in a Critically-Ill 
Population

Elizabeth Carlson and Mildred G. Kemp

Critically-ill patients are exposed to many factors that place them at risk 
for developing pressure ulcers (PU). Study aims: 1) identify how often the 
Braden Scale should be used to assess PU risk and 2) determine the relative 
contributions of the Braden subscales to predicting pressure ulcers. This 
predictive study of 120 critically-ill patients is being conducted in 3 
Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a Midwestern medical center. Every 12 hrs for 
the first 48 hrs post-ICU admission, each subject is rated on the Braden Scale 
and a battery of clinical data are gathered. Then these same data elements are 
collected daily for 3 days, and every Monday, Wednesday, Friday thereafter for 
1 month or transfer out of ICU. At the same time, another RA inspects the skin 
and records the site and stage of any PU. Eligibility criteria: > 20 years; 
English speaking; Medicus Type > 3 and/or intubated; and PU free. To date 111 
subjects have completed the study. Sample: mean age of 57 yrs; mean Braden 
score of 13.8; 55% male; 55% white, 34% black, 6.3% Hispanic; 57% medical, 38% 
surgical and 5% respiratory. Data analysis is progressing and will include 
Kaplan-Meier curves, logrank tests, proportional hazards models, and 
classification methods for identifying patients at high risk.
