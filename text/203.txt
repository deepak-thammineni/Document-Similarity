Determining the Relevance of Self-Care Nursing Theory for Diverse Cultural 
Populations

Marjorie A. Isenberg

This paper focuses on cross-national nursing research designed to determine 
the relevance of Orem's Self-Care Nursing theory in advancing knowledge for 
diverse cultural populations. The research presented here represents the 
collaborative effort of nurse-scientists from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Thailand, and the USA. Elements 
of the collaborative research program included in the paper are: (1) 
Validating propositions of Self-Care Nursing Theory with cross-cultural 
research populations; (2) Testing the validity and reliability of translated 
research instruments designed to measure self-care concepts; (3) 
Cross-national comparisons of research findings. The findings of the 
comparative studies identify universal elements of the Self-Care Nursing 
Theory. Moreover, the research results illustrate the benefits of 
collaborative nursing research in determining the global relevance of nursing 
theories for advancing nursing knowledge for the multicultural global 
community.
