Grief as a Basic Conditioning Factor Affecting the Self-Care Agency and Self-
Care of Family Caregivers of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury

Karen L. Goshorn Brown

Persons experiencing traumatic brain injury (TBI) may survive but be forever 
changed physically, cognitively, and/or behaviorally by the event. A sense of 
loss of the person known previously has been described by family caregivers 
(CGs). Grief is known to affect the morbidity and mortality of the bereaved. 
Thus family CGs may be at increased risk for illness and death. The purposes 
of this study are to test hypotheses derived from Orem's (1995) theoretical 
model relative to grief as a basic conditioning factor in TBI family CGs and 
to examine the effects of grief on the CGs' self-care agency and self-care.
The study uses a descriptive comparative cross-sectional design, with family 
CGs of persons with TBI compared to CGs of persons with spinal cord injury and 
paraplegia. Research instruments include the Functional Independence Measure, 
the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief, the Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale, 
the Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale, the Denyes Health Status Instrument, 
the Mental Health Inventory, and the Life 3 global measure of well-being. 
Health and well-being are measured as outcomes of self-care. Data analysis 
includes Pearson product-moment correlations, multiple regression, and ANOVA.

Results of this study should further explicate Orem's model. In addition it 
will alert nurses to the presence of self-care deficits in family CGs who 
cannot give optimum dependent-care while they themselves are in need.
