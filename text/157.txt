Predicting Success on NCLEX-RN: Use of Comprehensive Examinations

Alice Conway and M. Weissner

The successful outcome of baccalaureate nursing education is measured in part, 
through success in passing the nursing licensure examination. Some educators 
question if comprehensive examns, used as review tools or as mandatory 
requirements for course progression, might enhance success on the licensure 
exam. This study surveyed baccalaureate nursing programs that were members of 
the American Association of College of Nursing (AACN) to identify current 
patterns of use of comprehensive examinations of review courses. The study 
additionally sought information about remedial options available to students 
who failed the comprehensive exam. The literature revealed three general 
categories of predictors; preadmission criteria, grades during matriculation 
and comprehensive examinations. Four hundred and twenty surveys were mailed 
and two hundred and sixty returned for a return rate of 60%. Of those 
returned, eighty-five did not give an exam, but many were considering that 
option. One hundred fifty-two programs did give a comprehensive exam with 38% 
using the Mosby Assess Test, followed by the NLN Diagnostic Readiness Test. 
There was much variety in how the test was used and when given. Remedial 
options were extremely varied. 35% of the respondents stated that NCLEX-RN 
score simproved with the use of comprehensive examns. Other variables included 
revising senior courses to enhance critical thinking/decision making skills, 
and raising admission requirements.
