Coping With the Wait for Heart Transplant: A Spouse's Perspective

Eileen Collins, Margaret Schulz, Connie White-Williams, and Anne Jalowiec

Purpose: To examine coping strategies used by spouses of heart transplant 
candidates during the wait for heart transplant (HT).

Sample: 134 spouses of HT candidates: 121 F, 13 M; mean age=51 yrs.

Model: Lazarus stress/coping.

Tools: Jalowiec Coping Scale, Spouse Transplant Stressor Scale, Family 
Inventory of Resources for Management (FIRM), Ferrans & Powers Quality of Life 
Index. All tools had good psychometrics.

Results: The following coping behaviors were used most by spouses: tried to 
think positively, prayed/put trust in God, thought about the good things in 
life, tried to handle things one step at a time, and tried to keep busy. More 
effective coping strategies were associated with better quality of life 
(r=.44, p<0.001), more family resources available for coping (r=.46, p<0.001), 
and less stress (r=-.36, p<0.001). Optimistic, palliative, and supportant 
coping were more effective strategies for women than for men.

Implications: Describing coping strategies used by spouses will assist in 
designing interventions to help spouses with waiting for HT.
