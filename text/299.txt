Home Visits for Drug Addicted Childbearing Women

Linda Beth Tiedje, Claudia Holzman, and Dorothy Pathak

Treatment programs for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-using pregnant women 
are generally ineffective because of a focus that is male oriented and because 
emphasis has been primarily on fetal outcomes. This paper examines women's 
addiction to alcohol and other drugs using a feminist theoretical framework 
and reviews research on the importance of relationships in the etiology of 
women's drug-use behavior. Recent studies have suggested that home visit 
interventions are particularly well suited for drug abuse treatment for 
addicted childbearing women (Black, et al., 1994; Finkelstein, 1994; Starn, et 
al., 1994). The purpose of the paper will be: a) to propose an intervention 
model based on home visits and framed in the context of women's relationships; 
b) to describe common characteristics of successful home visit programs to 
addicted childbearing women; and c) to outline a randomized clinical trail to 
more rigorously test one particular home visit program. Recommendations 
summarizing the usefulness and possible cost effectiveness of home visit 
interventions to drug addicted childbearing women will also be made.
