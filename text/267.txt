Menopausal Symptoms: Hormone Replacement Therapy vs. Running

Patricia J. Estok and E. Rudy

The purpose of this study was to compare the physical, psychological and 
sexual symptoms that occur during menopause in women runners and nonrunners 
who are on hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) and those who are not. A 
stratified sample of 169 women with a mean age of 56.3 years included 42 
runners on HRT, 30 runners not on HRT, 48 nonrunners on HRT, and 49 nonrunners 
not on HRT. Mailed questionnaires included a Menopausal Symptom Checklist, 
Menopause Attitude Scale, Sexual Response During Menopause Scale, and a 
General Well-Being Scale. A major finding was that women currently taking HRT 
perceived an increased severity and/or frequency of menopausal symptoms prior 
to beginning HRT as compared to those women not taking HRT; X2(1)=4.42; p<.05. 
None of the other study variables differed significantly among the groups. 
Regardless of the women's decision to take or not take HRT, more than 50% 
expressed concern regarding their decision. There was a conspicuous lack of 
relationship between menopausal symptomatology and running. Those providing 
health care for women need to be cognizant of the degree of discomfort that 
may be experienced by menopausal women, the lack of alleviation of these 
symptoms by exercise alone, and women's concerns over their HRT decision.
