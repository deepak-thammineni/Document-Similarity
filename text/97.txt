Dietary Status of Persons with Dementia Living in the Community

Holly S. Spilinek and B. W. McCabe

Mangement of the nutritional health of persons with dementia presents 
challenges to caregivers. It has been well-documented that weight loss is a 
major problem as the dementia progresses. Little is known about factors that 
affect the nutritional status of persons with dementia who reside in the 
community. The purpose of this study was to describe dietary intake and 
factors that affect nutritional status of persons with dementia living in the 
community. A descriptive correlational design was used. Subjects were 30 
persons with dementia. Data collected were anthropometric measurements, 3-day 
dietary intake, and personal characteristicds. Data analyses indicate mean 
body mass index was above expected norms for men (27) and within norms for 
women (23); kilocalorie intake was below gender-specific RDAs; (male, x=2099; 
female, x=1470); statistically significant gender-based differences in 
nutrient intake of Kcal (t=3.36, p<0.004); Protein (t=3.15, p<0.006); 
Carbohydrate (t=2.43, p<0.03); fluid (t=2.23, p<0.03) were found. Fifty 
percent of teh subjects were below the recommended RDA for Vitamin D and 
calcium. The findings of this study indicate that the dietary intake of the 
majority of the subjects appears adequeate to meet known nutrient needs to 
basic physiological functioning. Continued research efforts are necessary to 
determine factors that lead to altered nutritional status of persons with AD 
as the disease progresses.
