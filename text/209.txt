A Descriptive Study of Factors Associated with Late Stage at Diagnosis of 
Breast Cancer Among Women in Ohio

Rosemary V. Chaudry

Breast cancer accounts for approximately 32% of total cancer incidence and 
approximately 19% of total cancer deaths among women in Ohio. Because 
mortality from breast cancer is associated with stage at diagnosis, public 
health efforts are focused on secondary preventive interventions for early 
detection. The purpose of this study is to identify groups of women at high 
risk for under-use of screening mammography by examining the relationships 
between distribution of stage at diagnosis of breast cancer and correlates of 
screening mammography utilization, using the distribution of stage at 
diagnosis as a surrogate measure of screening mammography utilization. The 
Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization guided the selection of 
variables. Data sources include a population-based statewide tumor registry of 
incident breast cancer cases (N=7018) census data, and health system data. 
Hierarchical regression analysis and discriminant analysis will be used to 
identify groups of women at high risk for advanced stage at diagnosis of 
breast cancer. Study results may be used by public health nurses for 
assessment of community health status and for targeting resources to high-risk 
groups of women.
