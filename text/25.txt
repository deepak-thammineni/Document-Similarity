Review of Effects of Domestic Violence on Children

Janice M. Attala, Kerry Bauza, Heather Pratt, and Denise Vieira

The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrative review of research 
studies concerning "effects on children witnessing domestic violence." Data 
bases were selected from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Health and PsychoInfo. Inclusion 
criteria addressed primary research in refereed journals during the last two 
decades which focused on children who had witnessed domestic violence (n=14 
studies). There was general agreement that children from domestic violence 
families tended to have more difficulties than children from non-violent 
families. Multi-disciplinary findings revealed that effects of witnessing 
violence were serious, varied and generally framed in emotional and behavioral 
manefestations. A total of 912 children and their parents comprised the 
subjects of this review. Implications for clinical nursing research in this 
area are considerable and recommended.
