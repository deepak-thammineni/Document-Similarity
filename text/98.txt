Family Involvement in Institutional Care: Predictors and Effects

Marie-Luise Friedemann and R. Montgomery

Families continue caring for elders in nursing homes. While found beneficial, 
family involvement is often poorly accepted by institutional staff. This 
interdisciplinary study determined the desired roles of families at the time 
of the elder's admission and the influence of family-focused nursing home 
practices, the elder's condition, and basic family patterns on the actual 
family involvement six months later. The study is based on the findings of 
Montgomery's earlier social nursing home theory about variations in families. 
Nursing homes in southern Michigan (134) were surveyed and categorized along 
family practices. Next, 216 family members were interviewed from 24 randomly 
selected homes. Analysis involved constructing measuring models for key 
concepts and hierarchical regression techniques. Family patterns measured with 
items of the ASF (Friedemann) and FES (Moos) predicted between 19 and 31% of 
the variance of 4 types of desired roles while the desired roles and the 
elder's ADL predicted 11 to 23% of the variance of the actual involvement. 
Nursing home policies and the elder's cognitive status had little influence. 
Families assumed roles in concert with their ususal patterns of functioning 
and the extent of involvement was similar in high and low-quality homes. 
Insitutional staff needs to be trained to respect differences among families 
and understand their need to be in control.
