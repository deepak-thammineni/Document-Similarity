Effects of Exercise on Knee Joints with Osteoarthritis: A Pilot Study of 
biological Markers

Older people who have Osteoarthritis (OA) of weight bearing joints are more 
likely than age matched peers to have a sedentary lifestyle. The effects of 
exercise on cartilage metabolism in OA are not well know. The purpose of this 
study was to determine the feasibility of using biological markers as well as 
clinical parameters to measure the effects of a low intensity weight bearing 
exercise program on community dwelling individuals (mean age=69.5 yr.) with OA 
of the knee. Synovial fluid keratan sulfate and hydroxyproline were measured 
as biological markers of knee joint cartilage degradation. The Arthritis 
Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) were used to measure health status and a 
Visual Analog Scale was used for pain assessment before and after 
intervention. An exercise group (n=15) received a thrice weekly 12 week low 
intensity exercise program and a weekly educational program. A minimal 
treatment group (n=15) received the education program only. Synovial fluid was 
obtained in 11 subjects before and after the intervention. Levels of keratan 
sulfate and hydroxyproline did not increase. Pain levels declined in the 
exercise group and both groups showed improvement on the AIMS. These data 
provide no evidence that this program of exercise increases cartilage 
degradation and supports use of biological and clinical parameters to examine 
outcomes of exercise as an intervention for OA of the knee.
